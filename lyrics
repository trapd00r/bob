Well I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in.
Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
When you get a crazy notion, jumpin' all over me
Well you give me the blues because you're satisfied
An' you give me the blues I wanna lay down and die.

I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand
You're takin' all my money and give it to another man.
Well you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brain
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane
You give me the blues because you're satisfied
You give me the blues I wanna lay down and die
Well you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die


Ramblin' outa the wild West,
Leavin' the towns I love the best.
Thought I'd seen some ups and down,
Til I come into New York town.
People goin' down to the ground,
Buildings goin' up to the sky.

Wintertime in New York town,
The wind blowin' snow around.
Walk around with nowhere to go,
Somebody could freeze right to the bone.
I froze right to the bone.
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years;
I didn't feel so cold then.

I swung on to my old guitar,
Grabbed hold of a subway car,
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride,
I landed up on the downtown side;
Greenwich Village.

I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block.
Got on the stage to sing and play,
Man there said, "Come back some other day,
You sound like a hillbilly;
We want folk singers here."

Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play,
Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day.
I blowed inside out and upside down.
The man there said he loved m' sound,
He was ravin' about how he loved m' sound;
Dollar a day's worth.

And after weeks and weeks of hangin' around,
I finally got a job in New York town,
In a bigger place, bigger money too,
Even joined the union and paid m' dues.

Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen.
It didn't take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin' about.
A lot of people don't have much food on their table,
But they got a lot of forks n' knives,
And they gotta cut somethin'.

So one mornin' when the sun was warm,
I rambled out of New York town.
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies.
So long, New York.
Howdy, East Orange.


Well, in my time of dying don't want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is take my body home
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

Well, meet me Jesus, meet me, meet me in the middle of the air
If these wings should fail to me,
Lord, won't you meet me with another girl ?
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry
All I want you to do is take me when I die
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.


Man of Constant Sorrow,
I've seen trouble all my days.
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised.

Your mother says I'm a stranger;
My face you'll never see no more.
But theres one promise, darling,
I'll see you on Gods golden shore.

Through this open world I'm about to ramble, Through ice and snows, sleet
and rain,
I'm about to ride that mornin railroad,
Praps I'll die on that train.

I'm going back to Colorado,
The place I started from.
If I'd knowed how bad you'd treat me,
Honey I never would have come.

Honey, if you don't think I love you
Just look what a fool I been.
And if you dont think I'm sinkin'
Honey, look what a hole I'm in.

Its a hard, hard road to travel
When you can't be satisfied.
I've got a rope that's hanging oer me
And the devil's at my side.
(by Bukka White)

Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down

Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.

I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Yes I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying.


I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found Fenneario.

Well, as we marched down, as we marched down
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio'
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O

Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O
What will your mother say to know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?

Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs,
Pretty Peggy-O Come a-running down your stairs
Combing back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io.

The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O
The lieutenant he has gone, long gone
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo.

Well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O
Well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid
He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O.

Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.

Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.

Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51.

Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.

- I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt. He lives in Cambridge. Ric is a
blues guitarplayer. I met him one day on The green pastures of the Harvard
University. -

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world If you just let me follow
you down.

Can I come home with you, baby can I come home with you ?
Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world If you just let me come
home with you.

Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world If you just let me follow
you down.

Yes I'll do anything in this godalmighty world If you just let me follow
you down.

Bob Dylan

There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm a-one

My mother was a taylor
She sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pace the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Oh tell my baby sister
Not to do as I have done
But to shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun

Well, it's one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I'm a-goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm goin' back to end my life
Down in the Risin' Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Risin' Sun
It's been the ruin of many poor girl
And me, oh God, Im a-one


I was born in dixie in a boomers shack,
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was comin I had to cry,
Hummin all the drivers with my lullaby
Ive got the freight train blues (hee, hee, hoo)
Oh, lawdy mama got em on the bottom of my ramblin shoes

And when the whistle blows, I gotta go
Baby dont you know
It looks like Im never gonna lose
The freight train blues.

Well, my daddy was a fireman in a house out here
She was the only daughter of the engineer
Sweetheart of the brakeman, that aint no joke
Its a shame the way she keeps a good man broke.
I got the freight train blues (hee, hee, hoo)
Oh, lawdy I got em in the bottom of my ramblin shoes

And when the whistle blows, I gotta go
Oh mama dont you know
It looks like Im never gonna lose
The freight train blues.

Well, the only thing that makes you laugh again
Is a south bound whistle on a south bound train
Evry place I want to go
I never go because you know
Because I got the freight train blues (hee, hee, hoo)
Oh, lawdy mama, got em on the bottom of my ramblin shoes

Bob Dylan

I'm out here a thousand miles from my home
Walkin' a road other men have gone down
I'm seein' your world of people and things
Of paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
'Bout a funny old world that's comin' along
See, it's sick and it's hungry and it's tired and it's torn
It looks like it's dyin' and it's hardly been born.

Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things I'm a-sayin', and many a-times more
I'm a-singin' every song, but I can't sing enough
Cause there's not many men done the things that you done.

Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And all the good people that have travelled with you
Here's to the hearts and hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind

I'm a-leavin' tomorrow, but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I'd been hittin' some hard travelin' too.

(Lemon Jefferson)

Well there's one kind of flavor I'll ask for you
Well there's one kind of flavor I'll ask for you
There's just one kind of flavor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean.

And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground.

Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is under the ground.

Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone.

And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And I believe what the father told.

And there's one last flavor I'll ask for you
And there's one last flavor I'll ask for you
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean.






How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, 'n' how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, 'n' how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, 'n' how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
The answer is blowin' in the wind.

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, 'n' how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, 'n' how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind,
The answer is blowin' in the wind.


Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.

Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howlin' winds.

Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,
That's the way I remember her best.

I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night,
In the brightness of my day.

So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine.


Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead


Well, I'm walkin' down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand.
Yes, I'm walkin' down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand.
Lord, I really miss my baby,
She's in some far-off land.

Well, your streets are gettin' empty,
Lord, your highway's gettin' filled.
And your streets are gettin' empty
And your highway's gettin' filled.
Well, the way I love that woman,
I swear it's bound to get me killed.

Well, I been gamblin' so long,
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Yes, I been gamblin' so long,
Lord, I ain't got much more to lose.
Right now I'm havin' trouble,
Please don't take away my highway shoes.

Well, I'm bound to get lucky, baby,
Or I'm bound to die tryin'.
Yes, I'm a-bound to get lucky, baby,
Lord, Lord I'm a-bound to die tryin'.
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And we'll leave this ol' highway behind.

Well, the ocean took my baby,
My baby stole my heart from me.
Yes, the ocean took my baby,
My baby took my heart from me.
She packed it all up in a suitcase,
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.

So, I'm a-walkin' down your highway
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.
Yes, I'm a-walkin' down your highway
Just as far as my eyes can see.
From the Golden Gate Bridge
All the way to the Statue of Liberty.


Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are ridin' down the line
Fixin' ev'rybody's troubles
Ev'rybody's 'cept mine
Somebody musta tol' 'em
That I was doin' fine

Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothin' in your heads
I got a real gal I'm lovin'
And Lord I'll love her till I'm dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

Lord, I ain't goin' down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don't have no sports car
And I don't even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block

Well, the wind keeps a-blowin' me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don't step on me

Well, lookit here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!


Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it,
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.


It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right

It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Like you never did before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just say fare thee well
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right


Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
The sun don't shine above the ground
Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town

He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

Oxford Town around the bend
He come in to the door, he couldn't get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my frien'?

Me and my gal, my gal's son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don't even know why we come
Goin' back where we come from

Oxford Town in the afternoon
Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune
Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon

Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Ev'rybody's got their heads bowed down
The sun don't shine above the ground
Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town


Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,
I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three,
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he could say.
He said it was a bad dream.
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,
They were my own dreams and they're only in my head.

I said, "Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain."
He said, "Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane,"
He grabbed my arm, I said "Ouch!"
As I landed on the psychiatric couch,
He said, "Tell me about it."

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,
It was all over by quarter past.
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on.

Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town.
I stood a-wondering which way to go,
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road.
It was a normal day.

Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell,
"Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man."
A shotgun fired and away I ran.
I don't blame them too much though,
I know I look funny.

Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man, I said, "Howdy friend,
I guess there's just us two."
He screamed a bit and away he flew.
Thought I was a Communist.

Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave,
"Let's go and play Adam and Eve."
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'
When she said, "Hey man, you crazy or sumpin',
You see what happened last time they started."

Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody aroun',
I got into the driver's seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac.
Good car to drive after a war.

Well, I remember seein' some ad,
So I turned on my Conelrad.
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill,
So the radio didn't work so well.
Turned on my record player
It was Rock-A-Day, Johnny singin',
"Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa,
Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah."

I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,
I needed somebody to talk to.
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind.
"When you hear the beep
It will be three o'clock,"
She said that for over an hour
And I hung it up.

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,
Sayin, "Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams,
But mine was a little different you see.
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.
I didn't see you around."

Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody's having them dreams.
Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else.
Half of the people can be part right all of the time,
Some of the people can be all right part of the time.
But all of the people cant be right all of the time.
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.
"I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours,"
I said that.


Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, where you been so long?
I been worr'in' 'bout you, baby,
Baby, please come home.

I got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
I got a bird that whistles,
I got a bird that sings.
But I ain' a-got Corrina,
Life don't mean a thing.

Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, you're on my mind.
Corrina, Corrina,
Gal, you're on my mind.
I'm a-thinkin' 'bout you, baby,
I just can't keep from crying.


Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance,
Ah'll do anything with you.
Well, I'm a-walkin' down the road
With my head in my hand,
I'm lookin' for a woman
Needs a worried man.
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
'Low me just-a one more chance.

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane.
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train.
Well, I've been lookin' all over
For a gal like you,
I can't find nobody
So you'll have to do.
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
'Low me just-a one more chance.

Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you.
Honey, just allow me one more chance,
Ah'll do anything with you.
Well, lookin' for a woman
That ain't got no man,
Is just lookin' for a needle
That is lost in the sand.
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,
'Low me just-a one more chance.


Well I took me a woman late last night
I was three fourths drunk she looked alright 'Till she started peelin' off
her onion gook She took off her wig said "how do I look" I was high flying
Bare naked
Out the window

Well sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
It don't hurt me none don't hurt my pride Cause I got my little lady right
by my side She's a-tryin to hide
Pretendin' she don't know me

I'se out there paintin' on the old wood shed When a can of black paint did
fell on my head I went down to scrub and rub but
I had to sit in back of the tub
Cost me a quarter
Half price

My telephone rang it would not stop
It's president kennedy callin me up
He said "My friend Bob
What do we need to make the country grow?" I said "My friend John
Brigette Bardot
Sophia Lauren
Anita Ickberg
Country'll grow."

I got a woman she's five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts Tickles my nose, pats me on
the head
Rolls me over and kicks me outa bed
Shes' a man eater
Meat grinder
Bad loser.

Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time I got a woman who works
herself blind
Works up to her britches, up to her neck Writes me letters and sends me
checks
She's a humdinger. folk singer.

Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed I was half asleep
Chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air raid drill i jumped the fallout shelter.
I jumped the string bean.
I jumped the tv dinner.
I jumped the shotgun.

Man on the stand wants my vote
He's a-runnin for office on a ballot note Out there preachin' in front of
the steeple Tellin' me loves all kinds of people
He's eatin' bagels
He's eatin' pizza
He's eatin' chitlins

Oh, I set me down on the televison floor Flipped the channel to numebr 4
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
Greasy kid stuff
What I wanna know mr. football man is what do you do about Willie Mays
Martin Luther King
Ola Tungee

Well the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great grandaughter of mr clean
She takes about 15 baths as day
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face
She's insane

Well you ask me why I'm drunk all the time Levels my head and eases my
mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see betters days and I do better things Catch dinosaurs
Make love to elizabeth taylor
Catch hell from richard burton






Come gather round people wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a changing

Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pens
And keep your eyes open, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, the wheel's still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
Oh the loser will be later to win
For the times, they are a changing

Come senators, congressmen, please head the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be her that has stalled
The battle outside ragging will soon shake your windows
And rattle your hall
For the times, they are a changing

Come mothers and fathers all over this land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughter are beyond your command
Your old role is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand
For the times they are a changing

The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one will later be fast
And the present now will soon be the past
The order is rapidly fading
The first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a changing


Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin' down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born


Oh my name it is nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I's taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that land that I live in
Has God on its side.

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side.

Oh the Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I's made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side.

Oh the First World War, boys
It closed out its fate
The reason for fighting
I never got straight
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don't count the dead
When God's on your side.

When the Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side.

I've learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life
If another war starts
It's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side.

But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God's on your side.

In a many dark hour
I've been thinkin' about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you
You'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side.

So now as I'm leavin'
I'm weary as Hell
The confusion I'm feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
If God's on our side
He'll stop the next war.


Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark.
As the night comes in a-fallin',
The dogs 'll lose their bark.
An' the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind,
For I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.

From the crossroads of my doorstep,
My eyes they start to fade,
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid.
An' I gaze back to the street,
The sidewalk and the sign,
And I'm one too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind.

It's a restless hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good,
When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
You can say it just as good.
You're right from your side,
I'm right from mine.
We're both just too many mornings
An' a thousand miles behind.


Come gather 'round friends
And I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron pits ran plenty.
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty.

In the north end of town,
My own children are grown
But I was raised on the other.
In the wee hours of youth,
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother.

The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door,
The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming.
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him.

Well a long winter's wait,
From the window I watched.
My friends they couldn't have been kinder.
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner.

Oh the years passed again
And the givin' was good,
With the lunch bucket filled every season.
What with three babies born,
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason.

Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut,
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen.
'Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'.

They complained in the East,
They are paying too high.
They say that your ore ain't worth digging.
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothing.

So the mining gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking.
Where the sad, silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking.

I lived by the window
As he talked to himself,
This silence of tongues it was building.
Then one morning's wake,
The bed it was bare,
And I's left alone with three children.

The summer is gone,
The ground's turning cold,
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'.
My children will go
As soon as they grow.
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.


A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood.
A finger fired the trigger to his name.
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man's brain
But he can't be blamed
He's only a pawn in their game.

A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
"You got more than the blacks, don't complain.
You're better than them, you been born with white skin," they explain.
And the Negro's name
Is used it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And the marshals and cops get the same,
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
And the hoof beats pound in his brain.
And he's taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
They lowered him down as a king.
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain:
Only a pawn in their game.


Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love,
I'm sailin' away in the morning.
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,
From the place that I'll be landing?

No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'.
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,
From across that lonesome ocean.

Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden,
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona.

Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.

That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin',
Is there something I can send you to remember me by,
To make your time more easy passin'.

Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,
It only brings me sorrow.
The same thing I want from you today,
I would want again tomorrow.

I got a letter on a lonesome day,
It was from her ship a-sailin',
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.

Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.
I'm sure your heart is not with me,
But with the country to where you're goin'.

So take heed, take heed of the western wind,
Take heed of the stormy weather.
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.


Oh the time will come up when the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be a-breathin
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins,
The hour that the ship comes in
And the sea will split and the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
And the tide will sound and the waves will pound
And the morning will be a-breaking

Oh the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path
And the seagulls will be a-smilin'
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
Oh the chains of the sea will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift as the main sail shifts
And the boat drifts unto the shoreline
And the sun will respect every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in
And the sands will roll out a carpet of gold
For your wearied toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real,
The hour that the ship comes in
And they'll raise their hands
Sayin' we'll meet all you demands
But we'll shout from the bow
Your days are numbered
And like Pharoah's tribe they'll be drownded in the tide
And like Goliath they'll be conquered


William Zantzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zantzinger for first-degree murder.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

William Zantzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen.
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
And she never done nothing to William Zantzinger.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.

In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zantzinger with a six-month sentence.
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now's the time for your tears.


Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I let it slip gladly past the hands of my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully.
But the bottles are done,
We've killed each one
And the table's full and overflowed.
And the corner sign
Says it's closing time,
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.

Oh ev'ry girl that ever l've touched,
I did not do it harmfully.
And ev'ry girl that ever I've hurt,
I did not do it knowin'ly.
But to remain as friends and make amends
You need the time and stay behind.
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past,
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.

Oh ev'ry foe that ever I faced,
The cause was there before we came.
And ev'ry cause that ever I fought,
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Must meet the dawn.
And if I see the day
I'd only have to stay,
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.

Oh, ev'ry thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung.
But it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes,
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But the time ain't tall,
Yet on time you depend and no word is possessed
By no special friend.
And though the line is cut,
It ain't quite the end,
I'll just bill farewell till we meet again.

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me.
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face,
And the dust of rumors covers me.
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick,
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick.
So I'll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn.






I ain't lookin' to compete with you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Simplify you, classify you,
Deny, defy or crucify you.
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

Frighten you or tighten you,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Chain you down or bring you down.

Take or shake or forsake you out,
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you.


I woke in the mornin', wand'rin',
Wasted and worn out.
I woke in the mornin', wand'rin',
Wasted and worn out.
Wishin' my long-lost lover
Will walk to me, talk to me,
Tell me what it's all about.

I was standin' at the side road
Listenin' to the billboard knock.
Standin' at the side road
Listenin' to the billboard knock.
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin',
Tickin' like a clock.

If I got anything you need, babe,
Let me tell you in front.
If I got anything you need, babe,
Let me tell you in front.
You can come to me sometime,
Night time, day time,
Any time you want.

Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm
Too high to fall.
Sometimes I'm thinkin'
I'm Too high to fall.
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm
So low I don't know
If I can come up at all.

Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway.
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway.
Though it's funny, honey,
I just don't feel much like a
Scarecrow today.


Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature's too hot for taming,
Your flaming feet burn up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me
Into reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
An' your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch black, come an' make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,
If it's you my lifelines trace.

I been wond'rin' all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding,
I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me,
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe, will I be touching you
So I can tell if I'm really real.


Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.


I'm just average, common too
I'm just like him, the same as you
I'm everybody's brother and son
I ain't different from anyone
It ain't no use a-talking to me
It's just the same as talking to you.

I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
I said "Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
The streets in heaven are lined with gold
I ask you how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first.
Wowee! pretty scary!

Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree
I want ev'rybody to be free
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think I'm crazy!
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.

Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead
He's a weird monkey, very funky.

I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was falling in my face
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.

I gotta woman, she's so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude
Puts bubblegum in my food
She's funny, wants my money, calls me "honey."

Now I gotta friend who spends his life
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.
I've got a million friends!

Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sister's home
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.
Hope I don't blow it.

I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course.
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.

Now you're probably wondering by now
Just what this song is all about
What's probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for.
It's nothing
It's something I learned over in England.


Ramona, come closer,
Shut softly your watery eyes.
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise.
The flowers of the city
Though breathlike, get deathlike at times.
And there's no use in tryin'
T' deal with the dyin',
Though I cannot explain that in lines.

Your cracked country lips,
I still wish to kiss,
As to be under the strength of your skin.
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I'm in.
But it grieves my heart, love,
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist.
It's all just a dream, babe,
A vacuum, a scheme, babe,
That sucks you into feelin' like this.

I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth.
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
On back to the South.
You've been fooled into thinking
That the finishin' end is at hand.
Yet there's no one to beat you,
No one t' defeat you,
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad.

I've heard you say many times
That you're better 'n no one
And no one is better 'n you.
If you really believe that,
You know you got
Nothing to win and nothing to lose.
From fixtures and forces and friends,
Your sorrow does stem,
That hype you and type you,
Making you feel
That you must be exactly like them.

I'd forever talk to you,
But soon my words,
They would turn into a meaningless ring.
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring.
Everything passes,
Everything changes,
Just do what you think you should do.
And someday maybe,
Who knows, baby,
I'll come and be cryin' to you.


I pounded on a farmhouse
Lookin' for a place to stay.
I was mighty, mighty tired,
I had gone a long, long way.
I said, "Hey, hey, in there,
Is there anybody home?"
I was standin' on the steps
Feelin' most alone.
Well, out comes a farmer,
He must have thought that I was nuts.
He immediately looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts.

I fell down
To my bended knees,
Saying, "I dig farmers,
Don't shoot me, please!"
He cocked his rifle
And began to shout,
"You're that travelin' salesman
That I have heard about."
I said, "No! No! No!
I'm a doctor and it's true,
I'm a clean-cut kid
And I been to college, too."

Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita.
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita.
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad,
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had.
He said, "What do doctors
Know about farms, pray tell?"
I said, "I was born
At the bottom of a wishing well."

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn't lie.
"I guess you're tired,"
He said, kinda sly.
I said, "Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove."
He said, "I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove.
Just one condition
And you go to sleep right now,
That you don't touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cow."

I was sleepin' like a rat
When I heard something jerkin'.

There stood Rita
Lookin' just like Tony Perkins.
She said, "Would you like to take a shower?
I'll show you up to the door."
I said, "Oh, no! no!
I've been through this before."
I knew I had to split
But I didn't know how,
When she said,
"Would you like to take that shower, now?"

Well, I couldn't leave
Unless the old man chased me out,
'Cause I'd already promised
That I'd milk his cows.
I had to say something
To strike him very weird,
So I yelled out,
"I like Fidel Castro and his beard."
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way,
As he came charging down the stairs
Sayin', "What's that I heard you say?"

I said, "I like Fidel Castro,
I think you heard me right,"
And ducked as he swung
At me with all his might.
Rita mumbled something
'Bout her mother on the hill,
As his fist hit the icebox,
He said he's going to kill me
If I don't get out the door
In two seconds flat,
"You unpatriotic,
Rotten doctor Commie rat."

Well, he threw a Reader's Digest
At my head and I did run,
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour,
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers.
Rita said, "Come back!"
As he started to load
The sun was comin' up
And I was runnin' down the road.

Well, I don't figure I'll be back
There for a spell,
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel.
He still waits for me,
Constant, on the sly.
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I.
Me, I romp and stomp,
Thankful as I romp,
Without freedom of speech,
I might be in the swamp.


Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Girls' faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

A self-ordained professor's tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
"Equality," I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.


I can't understand,
She let go of my hand
An' left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like t' know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close t' her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime,
She said she would never forget.
But now mornin's clear,
It's like I ain't here,
She just acts like we never have met.

It's all new t' me,
Like some mystery,
It could even be like a myth.
Yet it's hard t' think on,
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
From darkness, dreams're deserted,
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once an' talk,
'Stead of acting like we never have met.

If she ain't feelin' well,
Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back t' my face?
Without any doubt,
She seems too far out
For me t' return t' her chase.
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling,
I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't
An' evidently she won't,
She just acts like we never have met.

If I didn't have t' guess,
I'd gladly confess
T' anything I might've tried.
If I was with 'er too long
Or have done something wrong,
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide.
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played,
Her mouth was watery and wet.
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same,
She just acts like we never have met.

I'm leavin' today,
I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much.
But if you want me to,
I can be just like you
An' pretend that we never have touched.
An' if anybody asks me, "Is it easy to forget?"
I'll say, "It's easily done,
You just pick anyone,
An' pretend that you never have met!"


I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,
Gone as the season she's taken.

Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.

Of the two sisters, I loved the young.
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her.

For her parasite sister, I had no respect,
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.

Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,
The changes I was going through can't even be used,
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.

With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To a sin of love's false security.

From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, "Please,
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?"

And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces.

"The tragic figure!" her sister did shout,
"Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!"
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.

Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.
And she in between, the victim of sound,
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.

All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.

The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.

Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,
"How good, how good does it feel to be free?"
And I answer them most mysteriously,
"Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"


Go 'way from my window,
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I'm not the one you need.
You say you're lookin' for someone
Never weak but always strong,
To protect you an' defend you
Whether you are right or wrong,
Someone to open each and every door,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
Go lightly on the ground.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I will only let you down.
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Someone to close his heart,
Someone who will die for you an' more,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go melt back into the night, babe,
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's nothing in here moving
An' anyway I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
To gather flowers constantly
An' to come each time you call,
A lover for your life an' nothing more,
But it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.






Johnny's in the basement
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement
Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
It's somethin' you did
God knows when
But you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
But you only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
Look out kid
Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Don't try "No Doz"
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows

Get sick, get well
Hang around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell
If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail
Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid
You're gonna get hit
But users, cheaters
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders
Watch the parkin' meters

Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum
You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles

No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake in the morning,
Fold my hands and pray for rain.

To be just like them.
They sing while you slave and I just get bored.

My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true like ice, like fire
People carry roses
And make promises by the hour
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night wind blows cold n' rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

Well, I woke up in the morning
There's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's a-hidin'
Inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearin'
A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?

Well, I go to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

Well, I asked for something to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta think you're really weird.

Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real.

Well, there's fist fights in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
The mailman comes in
Even he's gotta take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?

I was riding on the Mayflower when i thought i spied some land
I yelled down to Captain Arab, i'll have ya understand,
Who came running to the deck and said "Boys! Forget the whale -
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails."
"Haul on that bowline!" we sang that melody,
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.
"I think i'll call it America." i said as we hit land.
I took a deep breath. I fell down, i could not stand.
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds
And said "Lets build us a Fort and start buying the place with beads.
"Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon
And throws us all in jail for carryin harpoons.
Aw, me, i busted out - dont even ask me how,
I went lookin for some help, i walked past a guernsey cow
Who directed me down to the bowery slums
Where people carried signs around sayin "BAN THE BUMS!".
I jumped right in line, sayin "I hope that i'm not late"
When i realized i hadnt eaten for five days straight.
I went into a restaurant lookin for the cook -
I told him i was the editor of a famous etiquette book.
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.
I ordered up some suzette, i said "could you please make that crepe?"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -
Food was flyin everywhere - i left without my hat.
I didnt mean to be nosey so i went into a bank
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.
They asked me for some collateral and i pulled down my pants.
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from france
Who invited me to her place. i went, but she had a friend who knocked me
out an' robbed my boots an' was i on the street again.
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.
I said "can you please help me out, i got some friends down the way".
The man said "Get out of here or i'll tear you limb from limb."
I said "you know, they refused Jesus, too." He said "You're not him.
Get out of here before i break your bones. i'm not your pop."
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.
I ran back outside and got into a cab
I ran out the other door - this english man said "Fab!"
As he saw me leap a hotdog stand and a chariot that stood
Parked across from a build advertising brotherhood.
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who i was
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.
He gave me his card and said "call me if they die."
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.
A pay phone was ringin - and it just about blew my mind -
When i picked it up an' said "hello", this foot came through the line!
Well about this time i was fed up at trying to make a stab
At gettin any help for my friends and Captain Arab.
I needed a coin to flip, like eather heads or tails,
Would let me know if i should go back to ship or back to jail.
So i hocked my sailor's suit an' i got a coin to flip.
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so i made it back to the ship.
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.
They asked me my name and i said "Captain Kidd".
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what i did.
I said "for the pope of Eyruke i was employed"
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.
Well the last i heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,
But the funniest thing was - as i was leavin' the bay -
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.
So i asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didnt drive a
truck??
He said his name was Columbus an' i just said "Good Luck..."

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet,
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship.
My senses have been stripped,
May hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step,
Wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade,
Into my own parade.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone,
It's just escaping on the run,
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme,
To your tambourine in time.
It's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind.
Down the foggy ruins of time,
far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted frightened trees,
Out to the windy bench,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky
With one hand waving free
Silhoutted by the sea
Circled by the circus sands
With all memory of fate
Driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there ain't no place I'm going to.
Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides
Upon 4-legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun, though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden
The lampost stands with folded arms, its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail though it shadows metal badge
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the gates of Eden
This savage soldier sticks his head in sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains
Upon the beach where hounddogs bay at ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his Lamp
Sits with utopian hermit monks, side-saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh
All except inside the gates of Eden
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the gates of Eden
The motorcycle black madonna two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver studded phantom cause the grey-flanneled dwarf to scream
As he weeps, two wicked birds of prey who pick up on his breadcrumbs sins
And there are no sins inside the gates of Eden
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions - each one wishing for what the other has
got
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what is not
It doesnt matter inside the gates of Eden
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free to do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the gates of Eden
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one
means
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the gates of Eden.


Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying.

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred.

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred.

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked.

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you.

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you.

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to.

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in.

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him.

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in.

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony.

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely.

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.


You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last.
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast.
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun,
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
All your reindeer armies, are all going home.
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.




Liner Notes from Highway 61 Revisited

I end up then
in the early evenin' punchin' at the blind
breathin' heavy
stutterin'
an' blowin'p
where t' go?
what is it that's exactly wrong?
who t' picket?
who t' fight? behind what windows
will I at least
hear someone from the supper table
get up t' ask
"did I hear someone outside just now?"
yesterday
an hour ago
it came t' me
in a second's flash
an' was all so clear
it still is now
yes it is
it's maybe hidin'
it must be hidin'
the shot has shook
me up ... for I've never
heard that sound before
bringin' wild thoughts at first
ragged wild
numb wild
now though they've leveled out
an' been wrung out
leavin' nothin' but the strangeness
the roots within a washed-out cloth
drippin' from the clothesline pole
strange thoughts
useless an' unnecessary
the blast it's true
startled me back but for a spell
content with
all pictures, posters an' the like
that're painted for me
ah but I turned
an' the nex' time I looked
the gloves of garbage
had clobbered the canvas
leavin' truckloads of trash
clutterin' the colors
with a blindin' sting
forcin' me t' once again
slam the shutters of my eyes
but also me to wonderin'
when they'll open
much much stronger
than anyone whose own eyes're
aimed over here at mine
"when will he open up his eyes?"
"who him? doncha know? he's a crazy man
he never opens up his eyes"
"but he'll surely miss the world go by"
"nah! he lives in his own world"
"my my then he really must be a crazy man"
"yeah he's a crazy man"

an' so on spangled streets
an' country roads
I hear sleigh bells
jingle jangle
virgin girls
far into the field
sing an' laugh
with flickerin' voices
softly fadin'
I stop an' smile
an' rest awhile
watchin' the candles
of sundown dim
unnoticed
unnoticed for my eyes're closed
---
The town I was born in holds no memories
but for the honkin' foghorns
the rainy mist
an' the rocky cliffs
I have carried no feelings
up past the Lake Superior hills
the town I grew up in is the one
that has left me with my legacy visions
it was not a rich town
my parents were not rich
it was not a poor town
an' my parents were not poor
it was a dyin' town
(it was a dyin' town)
a train line cuts the ground
showin' where the fathers an' mothers
of me an' my friends had picked
up an' moved from
north Hibbing
t' south Hibbing
old north Hibbing ...
deserted
already dead
with its old stone courthouse
decayin' in the wind
long abandoned
windows crashed out
the breath of its broken walls
being smothered in clingin' moss
the old school
where my mother went to
rottin' shiverin' but still livin'
standin' cold an' lonesome
arms cut off
with even the moon bypassin' its jagged body
pretendin' not t' see
an' givin' it its final dignity
dogs howled over the graveyard
where even the markin' stones were dead
an' there was no sound except for the wind
blowin' through the high grass
an' the bricks that fell back
t' the dirt from a slight stab
of the breeze ... it was as though
the rains of wartime had
left the land bombed-out an' shattered

south Hibbing
is where everybody came t' start their
town again. but the winds of the
north came followin' an' grew fiercer
an' the years went by
but I was young
an' so I ran
an' kept runnin'...

I am still runnin' I guess
but my road has seen many changes
for I've served my time as a refugee
in mental terms an' in physical terms
an' many a fear has vanished
an' many an attitude has fallen
an' many a dream has faded
an' I know I shall meet the snowy North
again -- but with changed eyes nex' time 'round
t' walk lazily down its streets
an' linger by the edge of town
find old friends if they're still around
talk t' the old people
an' the young people
running yes ...
but stoppin' for a while
embracin' what I left
an' lovin' it -- for I learned by now
never t' expect
what it cannot give me
---
Al's wife claimed I can't be happy
as the New Jersey night ran backwards
an' vanished behind our rollin' ear
"I dig the colors outside, an' I'm happy"
"but you sing such depressin' songs"
"but you say so on your terms"
"but my terms aren't so unreal"
"yes but they're still your terms"
"but what about others that think
in those same terms"
"Lenny Bruce says they're no dirty
words...just dirty minds an' I say they're
no depressed words just depressed minds"
"but how're you happy an' when're you happy"
"I'm happy now"
"why?"
"cause I'm calmly lookin' outside an' watchin'
the night unwind"
"what'd you mean 'unwind'?"
"I mean somethin' like there's no end t' it
an' it's so big
that every time I see it it's like seein'
for the first time"
"so what?"
"so anything that ain't got no end's
just gotta be poetry in one
way or another"
"yeah but..."
"an' poetry makes me feel good"
"but..."
"an' it makes me feel happy"
"ok but..."
"for lack of a better word"
"but what about the songs you sing on stage?"
"they're nothin' but the unwindin' of
my happiness"

Woody Guthrie was my last idol
he was the last idol
because he was the first idol
I'd ever met
that taught me
face t' face
that men are men
shatterin' even himself
as an idol
an' that men have reasons
for what they do
an' for what they way
an' every action can be questioned
leavin' no command
untouched an' took for granted
obeyed an' bowed down to
forgettin' your own natural instincts
(for they're a million reasons
in the world
an' a million instincts
runnin' wild
an' its none too many times
the two shall meet)
the unseen idols create the fear
an' trample hopes when busted
Woody never made me fear
and he didn't trample any hopes
for he just carried a book of Man
an' gave it t' me t' read awhile
an' from it I learned my greatest lesson

you ask "how does it feel t' be an idol?"
it'd be silly of me t' answer, wouldn't it...

A Russian has three an' a half red eyes
five flamin' antennas
drags a beet-colored ball an' chain
an' wants t' slip germs
into my Coke machine
"burn the tree stumps at the border"
shout the sex-hungry lunatics
out warmongerin' in the early mornin'
"poison the sky so the planes won't come"
yell the birch colored knights with
patriotic shields
"an' murder all the un-Americans"
say the card-carryin' American
book burners
(yes we burned five books last week)
as my friend, Bobby Lee,
walks back an' forth
free now from his native Harlem
where his ma still sleeps at night
hearin' rats inside the sink
an' underneath her hardwood bed
an' walls of holes
where the cold comes in
scared
wrapped in blankets
an' she, God knows,
is kind
an' gentle
ain't there no closer villains
than the baby-eatin' Russians
rats eat babies too

I talked with one
of the sons of Germany
while walkin' once on foreign ground
an' I learned that
he regards
Adolph Hitler
as we here in the states
regard
Robert E Lee

fasten up your
holster
mr gunslinger
an' buy new bolts
for your neck
there is no right wing
or left wing...
there is only one up wing
an' down wing

last night I dreamt
that while healin' ceilings
up in Harlem
I saw Canada ablaze
an' nobody knowin'
nothin' about it
except of course
who held the match
---
Yes, I am a thief of thoughts
not, I pray, a stealer of souls
I have built an' rebuilt
upon what is waitin'
for the sand on the beaches
carves many castles
on what has been opened
before my time
a word, a tune, a story, a line
keys in the wind t' unlock my mind
an' t' grant my closet thoughts backyard air
it is not of me t' sit an' ponder
wonderin' an' wastin' time
thinkin' of thoughts that haven't been thunk
thinkin' of dreams that haven't been dreamt
an' new ideas that haven't been wrote
an' new words t' fit into rhyme
(if it rhymes, it rhymes
if it don't, it don't
if it comes, it comes
if it won't, it won't)

no I must react an' spit fast
with weapons of words
wrapped in tunes
that've rolled through the simple years
teasin' me t' treat them right
t' reshape them an' restring them
t' protect my own world
from the mouths of all those
who'd eat it
an' hold it back from eatin' it's own food
(influences?
hundreds thousands
perhaps millions
for all songs lead back t' the sea
an' at one time, there was
no singin' tongue t' imitate it)
t' make new sounds out of old sounds
an' new words out of old words
an' not t' worry about the new rules
for they ain't been made yet
an' t' shout my singin' mind
knowin' that it is me an' my kind
that will make those rules...
if the people of tomorrow
really need the rules of today
rally 'round all you prosecutin' attorneys
the world is but a courtroom...
yes
but I know the defendants better 'n you
and while you're busy prosecutin'
we're busy whistlin'
cleanin' up the courthouse
sweepin' sweepin'
listenin' listenin'
winkin' t' one another
careful
careful
your spot is comin' up soon
---
Oh where were these magazines
when I was bummin' up an' down
up an' down the street?
is it that they too just sleep
in their high thrones...openin'
their eyes when people pass
expectin' each t' bow as they go by
an' say "thank you Mr. Magazine.
did I answer all my questions right?"
ah but mine is of another story
for I do not care t' be made an oddball
bouncin' past reporters' pens
cooperatin' with questions
aimed at eyes that want t' see
"there's nothin' here
go back t' sleep
or look at the ads
on page 33"
I don't like t' be stuck in print
starin' out at cavity minds
who gobble chocolate candy bars
quite content an' satisfied
their day complete
at seein' what I eat for breakfast
the kinds of clothes I like t' wear
an' the hobbies that I like t' do

I never eat
I run naked when I can
my hobby's collectin' airplane glue

"come come now Mr. Dylan our readers want
t' know the truth"
"that is the bare hungry sniffin' truth"
"Mr. Dylan, you're very funny, but really now"
"that's all I have t' say today"
"but you'd better answer"
"that sounds like some kind a threat"
"it just could be ha ha ha ha"
"what will be my punishment"
"a rumor tale on you ha ha"
"a what kind of tale ha ha ha ha"
"yes well you'll see, Mr. Dylan, you'll see"

an' I seen
or rather I have saw
your questions're ridiculous
an' most of your magazines're also ridiculous
caterin' t' people
who want t' see
the boy nex' door
no I shall not cooperate with reporters' whims
there're other kinds of boys nex' door.
even though they've slanted me
they cannot take what I do away from me
they can disguise it
make it out t' be a joke
an' make me seem
the ridiculous one
in the eyes of their readers
they can build me up
accordin' t' their own terms
so that they are able
t' bust me down
an' "expose" me
in their own terms
givin' blind advice
t' unknowin' eyes
who have no way of knowin'
that I "expose" myself
every time I step out
on the stage
---
The night passes fast for me now
an' after dancin' out its dance
undresses
leavin' nothin' but its naked dawn
proudly standin'
smilin' smilin'
turnin' turnin'
gently gently
I have seen it sneak up countless
times...leavin' me conscious
with a thousand sleepy thoughts
untamed
an' tryin' t' run
I think at these times
of many things an' many people
I think of Sue most times
beautiful Sue
with the lines of a swan
frightened easy
as a fawn in the forest
by this time deep in dreams
with her long hair spread out
the color of the sun
soakin' in the dark
an' scatterin' light
t' the dungeons of my constant night
I think love poems
as a poor lonesome invalid
knowin' of my power
t' destroy
the good souls of the road
that know no sickness
(you ask of love?
there is no love
except in silence
an' silence doesn't say a word)
ah but Sue
she knows me well
perhaps too well
an' is above all
the true fortuneteller of my soul
I think perhaps the only one
(you ask of truth?
there is no truth
what fool can claim t' carry the truth
for it is but a drunken matter
romantic? yes
tragic? no I think not)
the door still knocks
an' the wind still blows
bringin' me my memories
of friends an' sounds an' colors
that can't escape
trapped in keyholes
Eric...bearded Eric
far in Boston
buried beneath my window
yes I feel t' dig the ground up
but I'm so tired
an' know not where t' look for tools
rap tap tap
the rattlin' wind
blows Geno in
tellin' me of Philistines
that he'd run into durin' the night
he stomps across my floor
I laugh
an' drink cold coffee an' old wine
light of feelin'
as I listen t' one of my own tongues
take the reins
guide the path
an' drop me off...headin' back again
t' take care of his end of the night
slam an' Geno
then too is gone
outside a siren whines
leadin' me down another line
I jump but get sidetracked
by clunkin' footsteps
down the street
(it is as though my mind
ain't mine t' make up
any more)
I wonder if the cockroaches
still crawl in Dave an' Teri's
fifteenth street kitchen
I wonder if they're the same cockroaches
ah yes the times've changed
Dave still scorns me for not readin' books
an' Teri still laughs at my rakish ways
but fifteenth street has been abandoned
we have moved...
the cats across the roof
mad in love
scream into the drainpipes
bringin' in the sounds of music
the only music
an' it is I who is ready
ready t' listen
restin' restin'
a silver peace
reigns an'
becomes the nerves of mornin'
an' I stand up an' yawn
hot with jumpin' pulse
never tired
never sad
never guilty
for I am runnin' in a fair race
with no racetrack but the night
and no competition but the dawn
---
So at last at least
the sky for me
is a pleasant gray
meanin' rain
or meanin' snow
constantly meanin' change
but a change forewarned
either t' the clearin' of the clouds
or t' the pourin of the storms
an' after its desire
returnin'
returnin' with me underneath
returnin' with it
never fearful
finally faithful
it will guide me well
across all bridges
inside all tunnels
never failin'...

with the sounds of Francois Villon
echoin' through my mad streets
as I sumble on lost cigars
of Bertolt Brecht
an' empty bottles
of Brendan Behan
the hypnotic words
of AL Lloyd
each one bendin' like its own song
an' the woven spell of Paul Clayton
entrancin' me like China's plague
unescapable
drownin' in the lungs of Edith Piaf
an' in the mystery of Marlene Dietrich
the dead poems of Eddie Freeman
love songs of Allen Ginsberg
an' jail songs of Ray Bremser
the narrow tunes of Modigliani
an' the singin' plains of Harry Jackson
the cries of Charles Aznavour
through the quiet fire of Miles Davis
above the bells of William Blake
an' beat visions of Johnny Cash
an' the saintliness of Pete Seeger

strokin' my senses
down down
drowinin' drownin'
when I need t' drown
for my road is blessed
with many flowers
an' the sounds of flowers
liftin' lost voices of the ground's people
up up
higher higher
all people
no matter what creed
no matter what color skin
no matter what language an' no matter what land
for all people laugh
in the same tongue
an' cry
in the same tongue
endless endless
it's all endless
an' it's all songs
it's just one big world of songs
an' they're all on loan
if they're only turned loose t' sing

lonely? ah yes
but it is the flowers an' the mirrors
of flowers that now meet my
loneliness
an' mine shall be a strong loneliness
dissolvin' deep
t' the depths of my freedom
an' that, then, shall
remain my song

there's a movie called
"Shoot the Piano Player"
the last line proclaimin'
"music, man, that's where it's at"
it is a religious line
outside, the chimes rung
an' they
are still ringin'







Once upon a time, you dressed so fine,
Threw the bums a dime, in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware, doll, you're bound to fall."
You thought they were all kiddin' you.
You used to laugh about Everybody that was hangin' out,
But now you don't talk so loud, Now you don't seem so proud,
About havin' to be scroungin' your next meal.
How does it feel? How does it feel?
To be on your own. With no direction home.
A complete unknown. Like a rollin' stone.

You've gone to the finest schools, alright, Miss Lovely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
You never had to live out on the street,
But now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulders a Siamese cat.
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.

You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Never understood that it ain't no good.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You said you'd never compromise
With the Mystery Tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And he says, "Do you want to make a deal?"

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they've got it made.
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts,
You'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napolean in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls you you can't refuse
When you got nothin' you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal.


The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
the reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
a bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
at the head of the chamber of commerce

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans "I've just been made"
then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
and says "My advice is to not let the boys in"

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
"Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison"

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

Well John the Baptist after torturing a thief
looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
saying "Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
and dropping a barbell he points to the sky
saying "The sun's not yellow, it's chicken"

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
with a fantastic collection of stamps
to win friends and influence his uncle

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
at Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

Mama's in the factory, she ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley, he's lookin for food
I'm in the kitchen with the tombstone blues

Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped the bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge. . . .


Well I ride on a mailtrain baby, can't buy a thrill
Well I been up all night baby leanin' on the windowsill
Well if I die on top of the hill
and if I don't make it, you know my baby will
Don't the moon look good mama, shining through the trees
Don't the breakmen look good mama, flaggin' down the "Double-E"
Don't the sun look good goin' down over the sea
but don't my gal look fine when she's coming after me
Now the wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody but I could not get across
Well I wanna be your lover baby, I don't wanna be your boss
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost.


I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids
but my soulful mama you know she keeps me hid
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
Well if I go down diein' you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed
Well when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge
And then she comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with a thread
Well if I go down diein' you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed
Well she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead
Well if I go down dyin' you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed
Well you know I need a steam-shovel mama to keep away the dead
I need a dump truck baby to unload my head
She brings me everything and more and just like I said
Well if I go down dyin' you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed

Bob Dylan

You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked and you say "who is that man?"
You try so hard but you just don't understand
Just what you will say when you get home
Because something is happening here
And you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones

You raise up your head and you ask "is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says "its his"
And you say "what's mine?" and somebody else says "well WHAT is"
And you say "oh my god - am i here all alone?"
But something is happening here
And you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones

You hand in you ticket and you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak
Saying "how does it feel to be such a freak?"
And you say "impossible" as he hands you a bone
And something is happening here
But you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones

You have many contacts among the lumberjacks
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you
To all give a check to tax-deductable charity organizations

You've been with the professors, and they all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks
You've read all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read, its well known
But something is happening here
And you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones

Well, the swordswallower comes up to you and then he kneels
He crosses himself and he clicks his high heels
And without further notice he asks you how it feels
And he says "here is your throat back, thanks for the loan"
And you know something is happening
But you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones

Now you see this one-eyed midget saying the word "now"
And you say "for what reason?" and he says "how?"
And you say "what does this mean?" and he screams back "you're a cow!
Give me some milk - or else go home!"
And you KNOW something's happening here
But you dont know what it is, do you, Mister Jones

Well, you walk into the room like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law against you coming around
You should be made to wear earphones
Cause something is happening here
And you don't know what it is, do you, Mister Jones?


When your mother sends back all your invitations
and your father to your sister he explains
that you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
Won't you come see me Queen Jane, won't you come see me Queen Jane
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have leant you
and the smell of their roses does not remain
and all of your children start to resent you
Won't you come see me Queen Jane, won't you come see me Queen Jane
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
have died in battle or in vain
and you're sick of all this repetition
Won't you come see me Queen Jane, won't you come see me Queen Jane
When all of your advisers heave their plastic
at your feet to convince you of your pain
trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
Won't you come see me Queen Jane, won't you come see me Queen Jane
Now when all of the bandits you turn your other cheek to
all lay down their bandanas and complain
and you want somebody you don't have to speak to
Won't you come see me Queen Jane, won't you come see me Queen Jane


Oh God said to Abraham "kill me a son"
Abe said "man you must be puttin me on"
God said "no", Abe said "what"
God say "you can do what you want Abe but
the next time you see me comin you better run"
Well Abe said "where d'you want this killin done"
God said "out on Highway 61"
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
welfare department wouldn't give him no clothes
They asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said "there's only one place I know"
Sam said "tell me quick man I got to run"
Oh Howard just pointed with his gun
and said "that way down Highway 61"
Well Mack the finger said to Louie the king
"I got 40 red white and blue shoestrings
and a thousand telephone that don't ring.
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?"
and Louie the king said "let me think for a minute son"
Then he said "yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61"
Now the 5th daughter on the 12th night
told the first father that things weren't right
"my complexion", she says, "is much too white"
He said "come here and step into the light"
He said "hmm you're right let me tell the 2nd mother this has been done"
But the 2nd mother was with the 7th son
and they were both out on Highway 61
Now the roving gambler he was very bored
trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said "I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
and have it on Highway 61"


When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Eastertime too
and your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs when you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess out of you
Now if you see Saint Annie please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move, my fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength to get up and take another shot
and my best friend my doctor won't even say what it is I've got
Sweet Melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English and she invites you up into her room
and you're so kind and careful not to go to her too soon
and she takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon
Up on housing project hill it's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other though neither of them are to be what they
claim
If you're lookin to get silly you better go back to from where you came
because the cops don't need you and man they expect the same
Now all the authorities they just stand around and boast
how they blackmailed the sergeant at arms into leaving his post
and picking up Angel who just arrived here from the coast
who looked so fine at first but left looking just like a ghost
Now I started out on burgandy but soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough
but the joke was on me there was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City I do believe I've had enough


They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
"It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning
"You Belong to Me I Believe"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend
You better leave"
And the only sound thats left
After the ambulences go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
the fortunetelling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing
He's getting ready for the show
He's going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness A
nd though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah's great rainbow
She spends her time peeking I
nto Desolation Row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
As he when off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She's in charge of the cynanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
"Have Mercy on His Soul"
They all play on the penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
They're spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
"Get Outa Here If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row"

Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
"Which Side Are You On?"
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now, I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row





Bob Dylan

Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walking through the door
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are 'ung and able
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say good luck
Hey, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they are brave
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave
But I would not feel so alone
Everybody must get stoned


Well, early in the mornin'
'Til late at night,
I got a poison headache,
But I feel all right.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hopin' you'll come through, too.

Well, the hobo jumped up,
He came down natur'lly.
After he stole my baby,
Then he wanted to steal me.
But I'm pledging my time to you,
Hopin' you'll come through, too.

Won't you come with me, baby?
I'll take you where you wanna go.
And if it don't work out,
You'll be the first to know.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hopin' you'll come through, too.

Well, the room is so stuffy,
I can hardly breathe.
Ev'rybody's gone but me and you
And I can't be the last to leave.
I'm pledging my time to you,
Hopin' you'll come through, too.

Well, they sent for the ambulance
And one was sent.
Somebody got lucky
But it was an accident.
Now I'm pledging my time to you,
Hopin' you'll come through, too.

Bob Dylan

Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so
quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key
chain
And the all-night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's realy insane
Louise, she's allright, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror (veneer)
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall
to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
while I'm in the hall
How can I explain? Oh, it's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues You can tell by the way she
smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jellyfaced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze, I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin' "Name me someone that's not a parasite
and I'll go out and say a prayer for him." But like Louise
always says, "Ya can't look at much, can ya man?" As she, herself,
prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

Bob Dylan

I didn't mean to treat you so bad
You shouldn't take it so personal
I didn't mean to make you so sad
You just happened to be there, that's all
When I saw you say "goodbye" to my friend and smile
I thought that it was well understood
That you'd be comin' back in a little while
I didn't know that you were sayin' "goodbye" for good

But,
sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

I couldn't see what you could show me
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldn't see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didn't realize just what I did hear
I didn't realize how young you were

But,
sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

I couldn't see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew an' I took your word
And then you told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

But,
sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you


The guilty undertaker sighs,
The lonely organ grinder cries,
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way,
I wasn't born to lose you.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep,
They wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinkin' from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now all my fathers, they've gone down,
True love they've been without it.
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don't think about it.

Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid.
She knows that I'm not afraid
To look at her.
She is good to me
And there's nothing she doesn't see.
She knows where I'd like to be
But it doesn't matter.
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,
He spoke to me, I took his flute.
No, I wasn't very cute to him,
Was I?
But I did it, though, because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I ...
I want you, I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.


Oh the rag-man draws circles
Up and down the block.
I'd ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don't talk.
And the ladies treat me kindly
And furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape
Oh Mama,
Can this really be the end
To be stuck here inside of Mobile
with the Memphis blues again

Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells.
Speaking to a french girl,
Who says she knows me well.
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked,
Post the post office has been stolen
And the mail box is locked.
Oh Mama,
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Mona tried to tell me
To stay far away from the train line.
She said that all the railroad men
Drink your blood like wine.
An' I said "Oh, I didn't know that
But then again there's only one I've met
An' he just smoked my eyelids
An' punched my cigarette"
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rock
But everybody talk about
How badly they were shocked.
But me I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When he built a fire on main street
And shot it full of holes.
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Now the senator can down here
Showing everyone his gun.
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son.
An' me I nearly got busted
An wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Now the preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed when I proved to him
Then I whispered not even you can hide.
You see you're just like me
I hope your satisfied
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Now the rainman gave men two cures
Then he said "Jump right in"
The one was Texas medicine
The other railroad gin.
An like a fool I mixed them
An' it strangled up my mind
An' now people just get uglier
An' I have no sense of time.
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

When Ruthie says come see her
In her honkey-yonk lagoon,
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon.
An' I say, "Aw come on now
You must know about my dedutante."
An' she says, "Your debutante knows just what you need
But I know what you want."
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly.
It all seems so well timed.
An' here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh Mama
Can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again.

Bob Dylan

Well i see you got your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Yes, i see you got your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
You must tell me, honey, what your head feels under something like that-
Under your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well you look so pretty in it, honey, can i jump on it sometime?
Yes - i just want to see if its really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine-
Your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well if you want to the sunrise, honey, i know where
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
In your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
I asked the doctor if i could see you - "its bad for your health" he said
Yes, i disobeyed his orders, i came to see you but i found him there
instead
You know, i dont mind him cheatin on me,
But i sure wish he'd take that off his head-
Your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat
Well, i see you got a new boyfriend. no, i've never seen him before
Yes, i saw you making love with him - you forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But i know what he really loves you for
It's your brand new leopardskin pillbox hat


Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first, and I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here.
Ain't it clear...

That I just can't fit.
I believe it's time for us to quit.
But when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world.

You take just like a woman.
You make love just like a woman.
And then you ache just like a woman.
But you break just like a little girl.

Bob Dylan

You say you love me and you're thinking of me,
but you know you could be wrong.
You say you told me that you want to hold me,
but you know you're not that strong.
I just can't do what I've done before, I just can't beg you anymore.
I'm gonna let you pass, and I'll go last.
Then time will tell just who has fell, and who's been left behind.
When you go your way and I go mine.

You say you disturb me and you don't deserve me,
but you know sometimes you lie.
You say you shakin' and you're always achin',
but you know how hard you try.
Sometimes it gets so hard to care, It can't be this way ev'rywhere.
And I'm gonna let you pass, yes, and I'll go last.
The time will tell just who has fell, and who's been left behind.

The judge he holds a grudge, he's gonna call on you.
But he's badly built and he walks on stilts,
Watch out he don't fall on you.
You say you're sorry for tellin' stories
that you know I believe are true.
You say ya got some other kinda lover, and yes, I believe you do.
You say my kisses are not like his,
but this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is.
I'm just gonna let you pass, yes, and I'll go last.
The time will tell just who has fell, and who's been left behind.


Standing on your window, honey,
Yes, I've been here before.
Feeling so harmless,
I'm looking at your second door.
How come you don't send me no regards?
You know I want your lovin',
Honey, why are you so hard?

Kneeling 'neath your ceiling,
Yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but,
I'm helpless, like a rich man's child.
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your lovin',
Honey, why are you so hard?

Like a poor fool in his prime,
Yes, I know you can hear me walk,
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime,
Or is it just solid rock?

Well, I rush into your hallway,
Lean against your velvet door.
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor.
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your lovin',
Honey, but you're so hard.

Achilles is in your alleyway,
He don't want me here,
He does brag.
He's pointing to the sky
And he's hungry, like a man in drag.
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your lovin',
Honey. but you're so hard.

Bob Dylan

Well your railroad gate, you know i just cant jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard to see
I'm just sitting here, beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where you are tonight, sweet marie?

Well i waited for you when i was a half-sick
Yes, i waited for you when you hated me
Well i wai-aited for you inside of the frozen traffic
You, when you knew i had some other place to be
Now where are you tonight, sweet marie?

Well anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then not again not too many can be like you, fortunately
Well six white horses, that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentary
But to live outside the law you must be honest
I know you always say that you'll agree
Alright, so where are you tonight, sweet marie?

Well i dont know how it happened, but the river boat captain, he knows my
fate
But everybody else, even including yourself, they're just gonna have to
wait
Well, i got the fever down in my pockets
The persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes i can take him to your house, but i can't unlock it
You see you forgot to leave me with the key
Aww - where are you tonight, sweet marie?

I been in jail when all the mail showed
The man cant give his address out to bad company
And now i stand here looking at your yellowed railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet marie?

Bob Dylan

When she said, "Don't waste your words, they're just lies," I cried she
was deaf.
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes, Then said, "What else
you got left?"
It was then that I got up to leave But she said, "Don't forget,
Ev'rybody must give something back For something they get."

I stood there and hummed, I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot, And straightened her suit, Then she said,
"Don't get cute."
So I forced my hands in my pockets And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her My very last peice of gum.

She threw me outside, I stood in the dirt where ev'ry-one walked.
And after finding I'd Forgotten my shirt, I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it, And I tried to make sense,
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against

Her Jamaican rum And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, "No, dear." I said, "Your words aren't clear, You'd better spit
out your gum."
She screamed till her face got so red, Then she fell on the floor,
And I covered her up and then Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And when I was through, I filled up my shoe And brought it to you.
And you, you took me in, You loved me then, You didn't waste time.
And I, I never took much, I never asked for your crutch, Now don't ask for
mine.

Bob Dylan

Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to, I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I guess I could make it without you
If I just didn't feel so all alone

Don't let me down ,don't let me down
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
No I won't
You know I can if you can, honey
But honey, please don't

I got my black dog barkin', black dog barkin'
Yes it is now, yes it is now
Outside my yard
Yes, I could tell you what he means
If I just didn't have to try so hard

Your mama's workin',your mama's moanin'
She's cryin' you know, she's tryin' you know
You better go now
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I
But I just don't know how

Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers
Five believers, five believers
All dressed like men
Tell your mama not to worry because
Yes they're just my friends

Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
I'm callin' you to, I'm callin' you to
Please come home
Yes, I could make it without you honey
If I just did not feel so all alone

Bob Dylan

With your mercury mouth in the missionary times,
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,
Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last,
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,
Who among them do they think could carry you?

(Chorus):
Sad eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I leave them by your gate,
Or sad eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace,
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,
And your basement clothes and your hollow face,
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your sillouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Who among them would try to impress you?

(Chorus)

The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug,
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,
Who among them do you think could resist you?

(Chorus)

Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
How could they ever, ever persuade you?

(Chorus)

With your sheet metal memory of Cannery Row,
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul,
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?

(Chorus)













b.dylan 1965

you've gotta lotta nerve to say you are my friend
when i was down you just stood there grinnin'
you've gotta lotta nerve to say you have a helping hand to lend
you just want to be on the side that's winnin'
you see me on the street, you always act surprised
ya say "how are you?", "good luck", but ya dont mean it
when you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
why dont you just come out once and scream it
i know the reason you talked behind my back
i used to be among the crowd you're in with
but do you take me for such a fool, to think i'd make contact
with the one who tries to hide what he dont know to begin with?
you say i've let you down - ya know its not like that
if you're so hurt, why then doncha show it?
you say you've lost your faith, but thats not where its at
ya have no faith to lose - an' ya know it
no, i do not feel that good when i see the heartbreaks you embrace
if i was a master thief perhaps i'd rob them
and tho i know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
don't you understand, its not my problem?
i wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
and just for that one moment i could be you
yes, i wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
you'd know what a drag it is to see you







John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor,
He trav'led with a gun in ev'ry hand.
All along this countryside,
He opened a many a door,
But he was never known
To hurt a honest man.

'Twas down in Chaynee County,
A time they talk about,
With his lady by his side
He took a stand.
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out,
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand.

All across the telegraph
His name it did resound,
But no charge held against him
Could they prove.
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down,
He was never known
To make a foolish move.


As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains.
I offer'd her my hand,
She took me by the arm.
I knew that very instant,
She meant to do me harm.

"Depart from me this moment,"
I told her with my voice.
Said she, "But I don't wish to,"
Said I, "But you have no choice."
"I beg you, sir," she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth,
"I will secretly accept you
And together we'll fly south."

Just then Tom Paine, himself,
Came running from across the field,
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield.
And as she was letting go her grip,
Up Tom Paine did run,
"I'm sorry, sir," he said to me,
"I'm sorry for what she's done."


I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
Alive as you or me,
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery,
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold,
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold.

"Arise, arise," he cried so loud,
In a voice without restraint,
"Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint.
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own,
So go on your way accordingly
But know you're not alone."

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine,
Alive with fiery breath,
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death.
Oh, I awoke in anger,
So alone and terrified,
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried.


"There must be some way out of here,"
said the joker to the thief,
"There's too much confusion,
I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine,
plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."

"No reason to get excited,"
the thief, he kindly spoke,
"There are many among us
who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that,
and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."

All along the watchtower,
princes kept the view
While all the women came and went,
barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance
a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching,
the wind began to howl.


Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,
They were the best of friends.
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day,
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain,
Sayin', "Take your pick, Frankie Boy,
My loss will be your gain."

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin,
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him,
His head began to spin.
"Would ya please not stare at me like that," he said,
"It's just my foolish pride,
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide."

Well, Judas, he just winked and said,
"All right, I'll leave you here,
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want,
Before they all disappear."
"I'm gonna start my pickin' right now,
Just tell me where you'll be."

Judas pointed down the road
And said, "Eternity!"
"Eternity?" said Frankie Lee,
With a voice as cold as ice.
"That's right," said Judas Priest, "Eternity,
Though you might call it 'Paradise.'"

"I don't call it anything,"
Said Frankie Lee with a smile.
"All right," said Judas Priest,
"I'll see you after a while."

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down,
Feelin' low and mean,
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene,
Saying, "Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler,
Whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are,
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest."

"Oh, yes, he is my friend,"
Said Frankie Lee in fright,
"I do recall him very well,
In fact, he just left my sight."
"Yes, that's the one," said the stranger,
As quiet as a mouse,
"Well, my message is, he's down the road,
Stranded in a house."

Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked,
He dropped ev'rything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand.
"What kind of house is this," he said,
"Where I have come to roam?"
"It's not a house," said Judas Priest,
"It's not a house . . . it's a home."

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled,
He soon lost all control
Over ev'rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll.
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun,
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in ev'ry one.

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap,
And, foaming at the mouth,
He began to make his midnight creep.
For sixteen nights and days he raved,
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest,
Which is where he died of thirst.

No one tried to say a thing
When they took him out in jest,
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest.
And he just walked along, alone,
With his guilt so well concealed,
And muttered underneath his breath,
"Nothing is revealed."

Well, the moral of the story,
The moral of this song,
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong.
So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin',
Help him with his load,
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road.

Bob Dylan, 1968

Dear Landlord, please don't put a price on my soul,
My burden is heavy, my dreams are beyond control.
When that steamboat whistle blows,
I'm gonna give you all I got to give,
And I do hope you receive it well,
Depending on the way you feel that you live.

Dear Landlord, please heed these words that I speak,
I know you've suffered much, but in this you are not so unique.
All of us at times we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much,
And anyone can fill his life up with things he can see
But he just cannot touch.

Dear Landlord, please don't dismiss my case,
I'm not about to argue, I'm not about to move to no other place.
Now each of us has his own special gift,
And you know this was meant to be true,
And if don't underestimate me,
I won't underestimate you.


I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends,
Where another man's life might begin,
That's exactly where mine ends.
I have tried my hand at bribery,
Blackmail and deceit,
And I've served time for ev'rything
'Cept beggin' on the street.

Well, once I was rather prosperous,
There was nothing I did lack.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back.
But I did not trust my brother,
I carried him to blame,
Which led me to my fatal doom,
To wander off in shame.

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen,
Soon I will be gone,
But let me just warn you all,
Before I do pass on;
Stay free from petty jealousies,
Live by no man's code,
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road.


I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would've stayed home,
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone.
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with ev'ry breath,
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death.

I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain,
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,
Whose tears are like rain,
Who eats but is not satisfied,
Who hears but does not see,
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me.

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud,
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood,
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass.
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass.


There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come,
With a mind that multiplied
The smallest matter.
When questioned who had sent for him,
He answered with his thumb,
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter.

He stayed behind the assembly hall,
It was there he made his bed,
Oftentimes he could be seen returning.
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read,
"The soles of my feet, I swear they're burning."

Oh, the leaves began to fallin'
And the seas began to part,
And the people that confronted him were many.
And he was told but these few words,
Which opened up his heart,
"If ye cannot bring good news, then don't bring any."

Down Along The Cove

Down along the cove,
I spied my true love comin' my way.
Down along the cove,
I spied my true love comin' my way.
I say, "Lord, have mercy, mama,
It sure is good to see you comin' today."

Down along the cove,
I spied my little bundle of joy.
Down along the cove,
I spied my little bundle of joy.
She said, "Lord, have mercy, honey,
I'm so glad you're my boy!"

Down along the cove,
We walked together hand in hand.
Down along the cove,
We walked together hand in hand.
Ev'rybody watchin' us go by
Knows we're in love, yes, and they understand.

Bob Dylan

Close your eyes, close the door
You don't have to worry any more
I'll be your baby tonight

Shut the light, shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
I'll be your baby tonight

Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it

Kick your shoes off, do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight






Instrumental


To be alone with you
Just you and me
Now won't you tell me true
Ain't that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Ev'rything is always right
When I'm alone with you.

To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while life's pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when I'm alone with you.

They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But you're always what I'm thinkin' of
I wish the night were here
Bringin' me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms.

I'll always thank the Lord
When my working day's through
I get my sweet reward
To be alone with you.


I once held her in my arms,
She said she would always stay.
But I was cruel,
I treated her like a fool,
I threw it all away.

Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.
I must have been mad,
I never knew what I had,
Until I threw it all away.

Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Love and only love, it can't be denied.
No matter what you think about it
You just won't be able to do without it.
Take a tip from one who's tried.

So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,
For one thing that's certain,
You will surely be a-hurtin',
If you throw it all away.


Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
By golly, what more can I say,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

Peggy night makes my future look so bright,
Man, that girl is out of sight,
Love to spend the day with Peggy night.

Well, you know that even before I learned her name,
You know I loved her just the same.
An' I tell 'em all, wherever I may go,
Just so they'll know, that she's my little lady
And I love her so.

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Turned my skies to blue from gray,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
By golly, what more can I say,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

Bob Dylan
Lay lady lay
lay across my big brass bed
Lay lady lay
lay across my big brass bed

Whatever colours you have in your mind
I show them to you and you see them shine

Lay lady lay
lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay
stay with your man a while
Until the break of day
let me see you make him smile

His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen

Stay lady stay
stay with your man a while

Why wait any longer for the world to begin
you can have your cake and eat it, too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
when he's standing in front of you

Lay lady lay
lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay
stay while the night is still ahead

I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night

Stay lady stay
stay while the night is still ahead


One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be.
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright,
Lighting ev'rything in sight,
But tonight no light will shine on me.

Oh, it's shameful and it's sad,
I lost the only pal I had,
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rolling sky,
For tonight no light will shine on me.

I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true,
I had no idea what a woman in love would do!

One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss my darling so,
I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no light will shine on me.

One more night, the moon is shinin' bright
And the wind blows high above the tree.
Oh, I miss that woman so,
I didn't mean to see her go,
But tonight no light will shine on me.

Tell Me That It Isn't True

I have heard rumors all over town,
They say that you're planning to put me down.
All I would like you to do,
Is tell me that it isn't true.

They say that you've been seen with some other man,
That he's tall, dark and handsome, and you're holding his hand.
Darlin', I'm a-countin' on you,
Tell me that it isn't true.

To know that some other man is holdin' you tight,
It hurts me all over, it doesn't seem right.

All of those awful things that I have heard,
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
So darlin', you better come through,
Tell me that it isn't true.

All of those awful things that I have heard,
I don't want to believe them, all I want is your word.
So darlin', I'm countin' on you,
Tell me that it isn't true.

Country Pie

Just like old Saxophone Joe
When he's got the hogshead up on his toe
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

Listen to the fiddler play
When he's playin' 'til the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
What do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
Call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there

Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on 'er and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

I don't need much and that ain't no lie
Ain't runnin' any race
Give to me my country pie
I won't throw it up in anybody's face

Shake me up that old peach tree
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

Bob Dylan

Throw my ticket out the window
Throw my suitcase out there too
Throw my troubles out the door
I don't need them any more
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you

BRIDGE:
Is it really any wonder
The love that a stranger might receive
You cast your spell and I went under
I find it so difficult to leave

I can hear that whistle blowin'
I see that stationmaster, too,
If there's a poor boy on the street
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you

I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know about her,

You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her
finger tips, but I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know about her.

You think you'll find a heaven of bliss
in each caress in each tender kiss,
but I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know about her.

You stole her love from me one day,
you didn't care how it hurt me,
but you can never steal away
mem'ries of what used to be.

You think she's yours to have and to hold, someday you'll learn when her
love grows cold. But I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know about her.

Revised melody and new music by BOB DYLAN

I'm old Tom Moore from the Bummer's Shore in the good old golden days.
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too but what cares I for praise I
wander around from town to town just like a roving sign and all the people
say "There goes Tom Moore", in the Days of 'Forty-Nine.

In the days of old in the days of gold
how often times I repine
for the days of old when we dug up the gold in the Days Of 'Forty-Nine.

My comrades they all loved me well, jolly, saucy crew A few hard cases I
will recall though they all were brave and true. Whatever the pinch they
never would flinch, they never would fret or whine, The good old bricks,
they stood the kicks in the Days Of '49.


There was New York Jake, the butcher's boy, he was always getting tight
And every ttme that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight Then Jake
rampaged against the knife in the hands of old Bob Sign And over Jake they
held a wake in the Days of '49.


There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game Whether he
lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same He would ante up and
draw his cards and would you go a hat-ful blind In a game with death Bill
lost his breath in the Days Of '49.


There was Rag Shag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget He would roar all
day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roarin' yet One day he fell
in a prospect hole in a roarin' bad design And in that hole he roared out
his soul in the Days of '49.


Oh, the comrades all that I've had there's none that's left to boast And
I'm left alone in my misery like some a' poor wandering ghost And I've
passed by from town to town, they call me the ramblin' sign "There goes
Tom Moore of Bummer's Shore in the Days of '49".

In the Early Mornin' Rain
with a dollar in my hand,
with an achin' in my heart
and my pockets full of sand.
I'm a long way from home
And I miss my loved one so,
in the Early Mornin' Rain
and no place to go.

Out on runway number nine
Big seven-o-seven set to go,
Well, I'm stuck here on the ground
Where the cold winds blow.
The liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast,
There she goes, my friend
She's a' rollin' down at last.

Hear the mighty engines roar,
See the silver bird on high,
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly,
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
and the sun always shines,
She'll be flyin' over my home
In about three hours time.

This old airport's got me down,
It's no earthly good to me,
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Cold and drunk as I might be.
You can't hop a jet plane
Like you can a freight train,
So I best be on my way
In the Early Mornin' Rain.


Went out last night to take a little round.
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.

I began to think what a deed Id done.
I grabbed my hat and I began to run.
I made a god run but I ran too slow;
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner a ringin my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
He said Young man is you name Brown?
Remember you blowed Sadie down.

Oh yes sir, my name is Lee.
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
First degree and second degree.
If youve got any papers will you serve them to me?

Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black,
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I had no one to go my bail;
They crammed me back into the county jail.

Oh, yes they did.
The judge and the jury they took their stand.
The judge had the papers in his right hand.

Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes;
Oh, no!

Went out last night to take a little round.
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down.
I ran right home and I went to bed,
A forty-four smokeless under my head.


I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: Let it be me.

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling someone
Now and forever, let it be me.

Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be?

So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me.

One evenin', for pleasure, I rambled to view with the fair fields all
alone.
Down by the banks of Loch Erin,
where beauty and pleasure were known.
I spied a fair maid at her labors
which caused me to stay for awhile
And I thought of her "Goddess of Beauty" bloomin' bright star of Belle
Isle.

I humbled myself to her beauty,
"Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
abiding in cupid's fair throne?"
"Young man I will tell you a secret
it's true I'm a maid that is poor,
and to depart from my vows and my promise, that's more than my heart can
endure.
Therefore I remain at my service
and go through all my hardship and toil, and wait for the lad that has
left me
all alone on the banks of Bell Isle."

"Young maiden, I wish not to banter;
'tis true I come here in disguise.
I came here to fulfill our last promise, and hope to give you a surprise.
I've known you're a maid I've loved dearly and you've been in my heart all
the while; for me there is no other damsel
than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle.


Since you've been gone,
I've been walking around
With my head bowed down to my shoes.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.

I don't have to go far
To know where you are,
Strangers all give me the news.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.

I think that it's best,
I soon get some rest
And forget my pride.
But I can't deny
This feeling that I
Carry for you deep down inside.

If you see me this way,
You'd come back and you'd stay,
Oh, how could you refuse.
I've been living the blues
Ev'ry night without you.

Copper Kettle

Get you a copper kettle,
Get you a copper coil,
Cover with newmade cornmash
and nevermore you'll toil.

You'll just
lay there by the juniper
while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
in the pale moonlight.

My Daddy he made whiskey,
My Grandaddy did too,
We ain't paid no whiskey tax
Since seventeen ninty-two

We just

Build you a fire with hickory,
Hickory and ash and oak,
Don't use no green or rotten wood,
They'll get you by the smoke

While you

Get you a copper kettle,
Get you a copper coil,
Cover with new-made corn mash
and nevermore you'll toil.

Blue Moon,
you saw me standing alone
without a dream in my heart,
without a love of my own.

Blue Moon,
you knew just what I was there for,
you heard me saying a pray'r for
someone I really could care for.

Then suddenly there appeared before me
the only one my arms will ever hold.
I heard someone whisper, "Please adore me," and when I looked the moon had
turned to gold!

Blue Moon,
now I'm no longer alone,
without a dream in my heart,
without a love of my own,
without a love of my own.

The Boxer

I am just a poor boy,
Though my story's seldom told
I've squandered my resistance
for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises. All lies and jest, still a
man hears
what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

Li li li li li li li li li li.

When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railroad station running scared. Laying low, seeking out
the poorer quarters where the ragged people go Looking for the places only
they would know.

Li li li, etc.

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job,
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue I do declare, there were
times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there.

Li li li, etc.

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me, Leading me
Going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame,
"I am leaving, I am leaving."
But the fighter still reamins.

Li li li, etc.

- Bob Dylan

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Ev'rybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes.
Ev'rybody's in despair, ev'ry girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
Ev'rybody's gonna jump for joy.
Come all without...

I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste, just ain't my cup of meat.
Ev'ryone's beneath the trees, feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
All the pigeons gonna rum to him.
Come all without...

Let me do what I wanna do, I can recite 'em all
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on ev'ryones toes.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
Ev'rybody's gonna wanna doze.

Take Me As I Am

Why must you always try to make me over
Take Me As I Am or let me go.
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover Take Me As I Am or let me go.

You're trying to reshape me an a mold, love in the the image of someone
you used to know but I won't be a stand-in for an old love Take Me As I Am
or let me go.

You've tried to change me ever since you've met me Take Me As I Am or let
me go.
If you cannot overlook my faults forget me Take Me As I Am or let me go.

You're trying to reshape me an a mold, love in the the image of someone
you used to know but I won't be a stand-in for an old love Take Me As I Am
or let me go.

These are the words of a frontier man
Who lost his love when he turned bad.

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell here where I am
Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her that I had to see the world
Tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she'd better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail.

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please, don't mention the stage coach
And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day.

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know
My heart is aching for Mary
Lord know I miss her so
Just tell her that I went to Timbukto
Tell her I'm searching for gold
You can say she better find someone new
To cherish and to hold, oh Lord, this cell is so cold.


So run here baby
Put your little hands in mine
Ive got something to tell you
I know youre gonna change your mind

When things go wrong
So wrong with you
I hurts me too

I want you baby
Just to understand
I dont want to be your boss, babe
I just want to be your man

Now when you go home
You dont have to get along
Come back to me baby
Well its where you belong

I love you baby
And you know that its true
I wont mistreat you baby
Nothin in this world is like you

So run here baby
Put your little hands in mine
Ive got something to tell you
I know youre gonna change your mind

Minstrel Boy

Who's gonna throw that Minstrel Boy a coin? Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that Minstrel Boy a coin? Who's gonna let it down easy
to save his soul?

Oh, Lucky's been drivin' a long, long time and now he's stuck on top of
the hill
with twelve forward gears,
It's been a long hard climb,
and with all of them ladies though
he's lonely still.

Who's gonna throw that Minstrel Boy a coin? Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that Minstrel Boy a coin? Who's gonna let it down easy
to save his soul?

Well, he's deep in number and heavy in toil, mighty mockingbird, he still
has such a heavy load beneath his bound'ries.
But more than I can tell
with all of his trav'lin',
But I'm still on that road.

Who's gonna throw that Minstrel Boy a coin? Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that Minstrel Boy a coin? Who's gonna let it down easy
to save his soul?

I'll give you more gold
than your apron can hold
if you'll only
let your hair hang low.

You keep me worried and bothered
all of the time

New Morning

Bob Dylan 1970

If Not For You Babe, I couldn't even find the door
I couldn't even see the floor I'd be sad and blue
If Not For You

*verse*
If Not For You Babe the night would see me wide awake
The day would surely have to break It would not be new

If Not For You

*bridge*
If Not For You my sky would fall,
rain would gather too.
without your love I'd be nowhere at all, I'd be lost
If Not For You

*verse*
If Not For You The winter would hold no spring
Couldn't hear a robin sing I just wouldn't have a clue
If Not For You


Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree.
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',
But the next time I looked there was light in the room.
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees.
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,
Sure was glad to get out of there alive.
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.
And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,
Singing for me, well, singing for me.

Bob Dylan

Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart she was fine and good lookin'
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin
Stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love

BRIDGE:
Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain't no reason to go to the fair
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down
Ain't no reason to go anywhere

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away


Went to see the gypsy,
Stayin' in a big hotel.
He smiled when he saw me coming,
And he said, "Well, well, well."
His room was dark and crowded,
Lights were low and dim.
How are you?" he said to me,
I said it back to him.

I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out.
A pretty dancing girl was there,
And she began to shout,
"Go on back to see the gypsy.
He can move you from the rear,
Drive you from your fear,
Bring you through the mirror.
He did it in Las Vegas,
And he can do it here."

Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears,
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears.

I went back to see the gypsy,
It was nearly early dawn.
The gypsy's door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone,
And that pretty dancing girl,
She could not be found.
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota town.

Winterlude, Winterlude, oh darlin',
Winterlude by the road tonight.
Tonight there will be no quarrelin',
Everything is gonna be alright.
Oh, I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine.
You're the one I adore,
come over here and give me more,
Then Winterlude,
this dude thinks you're fine.

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign.
The snow is so cold,
but our love can be bold,
Winterlude,
don't be rude, please be mine.

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Winterlude, it's makin' me lazy,
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand.
Come out tonight, ev'ry thing will be tight,
Winterlude,
this dude thinks you're grand.


If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain.
The best is always yet to come,
That's what they explain to me.
Just do your thing, you'll be king,
If dogs run free.

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme.
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be,
To each his own, it's all unknown,
If dogs run free.

If dogs run free, then what must be,
Must be, and that is all.
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall.
In harmony with the cosmic sea,
True love needs no company,
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,
If dogs run free.

Bob Dylan

Can't you hear that rooster crowin'?
Rabbit runnin' down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through

So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

Can't you hear that motor turnin'?
Automobile comin' into style
Comin' down the road for a country mile or two

BRIDGE:
The night passed away so quickly
It always does when you're with me

Can't you feel that sun a shinin'?
Ground hog runnin' by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true


New morning . . .

Sign on the window says "lonely"
Sign on the door said "no company allowed"
Sign on the street says "y' don't own me"
Sign on the porch says "three's a crowd"
Sign on the porch says "three's a crowd"

Her and her boyfriend went to California
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune
My best friend said "now didn't I warn ya
Brighton girls are like the moon
Brighton girls are like the moon"

BRIDGE:
Looks like a-nothing but the rain
Sure gonna be wet tonight on main street
Hope that it don't sleet

Build me a cabin in Utah
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout
Have a bunch of kids who call me "Pa"
That must be what it's all about
That must be what it's all about


Slippin' and slidin' like a weasel on the run,
I'm lookin' good to see you, yeah, and we can have some fun.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.

Come on down to my ship, honey, ride on deck,
We'll fly over the ocean just like you suspect.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you.
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.

We'll fly the night away,
Hang out the whole next day,
Things will be okay,
You wait and see.
We'll go someplace unknown,
Leave all the children home,
Honey, why not go alone
Just you and me.

Comin' and goin' like a rabbit in the wood,
I'm happy just to see you, yeah, lookin' so good.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do (yes, you will!).

Like a needle in a haystack, I'm gonna find you yet,
You're the sweetest gone mama that this boy's ever gonna get.
One more weekend, one more weekend with you,
One more weekend, one more weekend'll do.


The man in me will do nearly any task,
And as for compensation, there's little he would ask.
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.

Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it anymore.
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me.

But oh!
What a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near.
Sets my a heart areeling
From my toes up to my ears.

The man in me will hide sometimes
To keep from bein' seen,
But that's just because he doesn't want
To turn into some machine.
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me.


Three angels up above the street,
Each one playing a horn,
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out,
They've been there since Christmas morn.
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash,
Then a lady in a bright orange dress,
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels,
The Tenth Avenue bus going west.
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around,
A man with a badge skips by,
Three fellas crawlin' on their way back to work,
Nobody stops to ask why.
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on their poles,
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls.
The angels play on their horns all day,
The whole earth in progression seems to pass by.
But does anyone hear the music they play,
Does anyone even try?


Father of night, Father of day,
Father, who taketh the darkness away,
Father, who teacheth the bird to fly,
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,
Father of loneliness and pain,
Father of love and Father of rain.

Father of day, Father of night,
Father of black, Father of white,
Father, who build the mountain so high,
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,
Father of time, Father of dreams,
Father, who turneth the rivers and streams.

Father of grain, Father of wheat,
Father of cold and Father of heat,
Father of air and Father of trees,
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories,
Father of minutes, Father of days,
Father of whom we most solemnly praise.

Bob Dylan

What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say
Daylight's sneaking' through the window
And I'm still in this all night cafe
Walking to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rolling slow
Sit out on this bank of sand and watch the river flow

Wish I was back in the city instead of this ol' bank of sand
With the sun beatin' down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go
But right now I just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow

BRIDGE #1:
People disagreein' on just about everything, yep
Makes you stop and wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw someone on the street
Who just couldn't help but cry

Wo, but this old river keeps on rollin' though
No matter what gets in the way and which was the wind does blow
And as long as it does I just sit here
And watch the river flow

BRIDGE #2:
People disagreein' everywhere you look
Makes you want to stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street

OUTRO:
Watch the river flow, watching the river flow
Watching the river flow
Well, I just sit out on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

















If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all

Yes, and only if my own true love was waitin'
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly poundin'
Only if she was lyin' by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again.

I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Or can't remember the sound of my own name

There's beauty in the silver, singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes.


Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you're seein' double
On a cord, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised that she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wastin' time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'em
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

BRIDGE:
Sailin'round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh to be back in the land of Coca Cola!

I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy had to be held down by big police Someday,
everything is gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece


They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection.
They every man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection,
Somewhere so high above the wall.
I see my light come shining,
From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I shall be released.

Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
(Well onder stands a man in this lonely crowd,)
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.
(A man who swears he not to blame.)
All day long I hear him cry shouting loud,
Calling out that he's been framed.
I see my light come shining,
From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I shall be released.

Bob Dylan

Clouds so swift, the rain won't lift
The gates won't close, the railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain't going nowhere

Ooo-wee, ride me high
Tomorrow's the day my bride's gonna come
Ooh, ooh, are we gonna fly
Down in the easy chair

I don't care how many letters they sent
The morning came and the morning went
Pick up your money, pack up your tent,
You ain't going nowhere

Ooo-wee...

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself to the tree with roots
You ain't going nowhere

Ooo-wee...

Gengis Khan he could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep
We'll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it

Ooo-wee...


Crash on the levee, mama,
Water's gonna overflow,
Swamp's gonna rise,
No boat's gonna row.
Now, you can train on down
To Williams Point,
You can bust your feet,
You can rock this joint.
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow.

Now, don't you try an' move me,
You're just gonna lose.
There's a crash on the levee
And, mama, you've been refused.
Well, it's sugar for sugar
And salt for salt,
If you go down in the flood,
It's gonna be your own fault.
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow.

Well, that high tide's risin',
Mama, don't you let me down.
Pack up your suitcase,
Mama, don't you make a sound.
Now, it's king for king,
Queen for queen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen.
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow.

There's guns across the river aimin' at ya
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.

Campin' out all night on the berenda
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.

Playin' around with some sweet senorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya
Billy, you're so far away from home.

There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces
There's always one more notch and ten more paces
Billy, and you're walkin' all alone.

They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.

Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley,
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you're so far away from home.

There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul.

The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown.
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

Hang on to your woman if you got one
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one
Billy, you been runnin' for so long.

Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you're so far away from home.

Knock..knock..knocking on heaven's door...
Knock..knock..knocking on heaven's door...
Knock..knock..knocking on heaven's door...

On a night like this
So glad you came around,
Hold on to me so tight
And heat up some coffee grounds.
We got much to talk about
And much to reminisce,
It sure is right
On a night like this.

On a night like this
So glad you've come to stay
Hold on to me, pretty miss
Say you'll never go away to stray.
Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss
It sure feels right
On a night like this.

On a night like this
I can't get any sleep,
The air is so cold outside
And the snow's so deep.
Build a fire, throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
On a night like this.

Put your body next to mine
And keep me company,
There is plenty a room for all,
So please don't elbow me.

Let the four winds blow
Around this old cabin door,
If I'm not too far off I think we did this once before.
There's more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss,
But it sure feels right
On a night like this.



I've just reached a place
Where the willow don't bend.
There's not much more to be said
It's the top of the end.
I'm going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.

I'm closin' the book
On the pages and the text
And I don't really care
What happens next.
I'm just going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.

I been hangin' on threads,
I been playin' it straight,
Now, I've just got to cut loose
Before it gets late.
So I'm going,
I'm going,
I'm gone.

Grandma said, "Boy, go and follow your heart
And you'll be fine at the end of the line.
All that's gold isn't meant to shine.
Don't you and your one true love ever part."

I been walkin' the road,
I been livin' on the edge,
Now, I've just got to go
Before I get to the ledge.
So I'm going,
I'm just going,
I'm gone.



Tough Mama
Meat shakin' on your bones
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stones.
Sister's on the highway with that steel-drivin' crew,
Papa's in the big house, his workin' days are through.
Tough Mama
Can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty
Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty
With that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet Goddess
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north
He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking
That was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess
Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.

Silver Angel
With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive.
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch.
Sweet Goddess
It must be time to carve another notch.

I'm crestfallen
The world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't a-haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
Dark Beauty
Meet me at the border late tonight.



Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.
You got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love.

Hazel, stardust in your eye
You're goin' somewhere and so am I.
I'd give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love.

Oh no, I don't need any reminder
To know how much I really care
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.

Hazel, you called and I came,
Now don't make me play this waiting game.
You've got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love.

- Bob Dylan

Something there is about you
That strikes a match in me.
Is it the way your body moves
Or is it the way your hair blows free.
Or is it because you remind me
Of somethin' that used to be
Somethin' that's crossed over
From another century.

Thought I'd shaken the wonder
And the phantoms of my youth.
Rainy days on the Great Lakes
Walkin' the hills of old Duluth.
There was me and Danny Lopez
Cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Somethin' there is about you
That bring back a long forgotten truth.

Suddenly I found you
And the spirit in me sings.
Don't have to look no further
You're the soul of many things.
I could say that I'd be faithful
I could say it in one sweet, easy breath.
But to you that would be cruelty
And to me it surely would be death.

Something there is about you
That moves with style and grace.
I was in a whirlwind
Now I'm in some better place.
My hand's on the sabre
And you've picked up on the baton
Somethin' there is about you
That I can't quite put my finger on.
- Bob Dylan

May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
And may you stay forever young
May you stay forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
And may you stay forever young
May you stay forever young

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
May you stay forever young


Bob Dylan

I hate myself for lovin' you And the weakness that I showed ...
You were just a painted face On a trip down Suicide Road.
The stage was set, the lights went out All around the old hotel
I hate myself for lovin' you And I'm glad the curtain fell.

I hate that foolish game we played And the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me Whoever would have guessed
I went out on Lower Broadway And I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep And angels play with sin

Heard your songs of freedom And man forever stripped
Acting out his folly While his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit He's beaten 'til he's tame
All for a moment's glory And it's dirty, rotten shame

There are those who worship loneliness I'm not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall Hasn't shown me nothing yet
I've paid the price of solitude But at least I'm out of debt

Can't recall a useful thing You ever did for me
'Cept pat me on the back one time When I was on my knees
We stared into each other's eyes 'Til one of us would break
No use to apologize What diff'rence would it make

So sing your praise of progress And of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo Whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck who shines on me Will tell you where I'm at
I hate myself for lovin' you But I should get over that



You angel you
You got me under your wing.
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing.

You angel you
You're as fine as anything's fine.
The way you walk and the way you talk
It sure plays on my mind.

You know I can't sleep at night for trying,
Never did feel this way before.
I get up at night and walk the floor.
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more and more.

You angel you
You're as fine as can be.
The way you smile like a sweet baby child,
It just falls all over me.

You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before,
Never did get up and walk the floor.
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more.

You angel you
You got me under your wing.
The way you walk and the way you talk
It says everything.



Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below.

You're beautiful beyond words
You're beautiful to me
You can make me cry
Never say goodbye.

Time is all I have to give
You can have it if you choose
With me you can live
Never say goodbye.

My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground.

The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand.

Oh, baby, baby, baby blue
You'll change your last name, too
You've turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hangin' down.



I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.

Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give,
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole,
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul.

You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie,
I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die.

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth,
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.

It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge,
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend,
And if there is eternity I'd love you there again.

Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride,
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Just bein' next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.

- The Band

When I get off of this mountain
You know where I want to go
Straight down the Mississippi river
To the Gulf of Mexico

To Lake George, Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
And she told me just to come on by
If there's anything she could do

{Refrain}
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Good luck had just stung me
To the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show

Odds were in my favor
I had him five to one
When that nag came around the track
Sure enough he had won

{Refrain}

I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and blew it in my face
Just for a laugh

Now there's one thing in the whole wide world
I sure would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
Dips her doughnut in my tea

{Refrain}

Now me and my mate were back at the shack
We had Spike Jones on the box
She said, "I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk"

Now that just gave my heart a fall
To the bottom of my feet
And I swore and I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat

{Refrain}

Now, it's hot in California
And up north it's pretty cold
And this living off the road
Is getting pretty old

So I guess I'll call up my big mama
Tell her I'll be rolling in
Bet you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted
To see my sweet Bessie again

{Refrain}

Other Versions Of Tangled Up In Blue

Tangled Up In Blue

Early one morning the sun was shinin'
I was layin' in bed.
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said that our lives together,
Sure was gonna be rough.
They never did like Mama's home-made dress,
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough.
And I was standing on the side of the road,
Rain falling on my shoes.
Heading out for the old east coast,
Lord knows I've paid some dues,
Getting through,
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over her shoulder
We'll meet again some day
On the avenue
Tangled up in Blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen alot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me Don't I know your name
I muttered something undernaeth my breath
She studdied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type."
She opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started dealing in slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom finally fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue."

So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they do with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue.

Bob Dylan

Early one morning the sun was shinin'
He was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress,
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standin' at the side of the road

Heading out for the old East Coast
Lord knows he paid some dues, gettin' through
Tangled up in blue.

Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walkin' away
And she said "This ain't the end
We'll meet again some day, on the avenue,
Tangled up in blue."

He had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But he never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
So he drifted down to L.A.
Where he reckoned he tried his luck
Workin' for a-while in an airplane plant
Loading cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In a spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Sayin' to me "What's your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoes
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"Thought you'd never say hello", she said

He was always in a hurry
Too busy or too stoned
And everything she ever planned
Just had to be postponed
She thought they were successful
He thought they were blessed
With objects and material things
But I never was impressed
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm going back again
Got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctor' wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just started from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue.

/ Bob Dylan

Early one morning the sun was shinin'
And I was layin' in bed
Wond'ring if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said that our lives together
Well, it sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress,
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Ready to pay some dues, gettin' through

She was married when we first met

I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
And we drove that car as far as we could
We abandoned it way out west
Splittin' up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing that it was best
She turned around to look at me
One more time as I was walking away
Sayin' over her shoulder
"Boy, we're bound to meet again some day, on the avenue,"
"Tangled up in blue."

I remember stayin' in the north woods
Livin' in a vagabond hotel
One day during the pourin' rain
I could feel how the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
I was lucky not to be destroyed
I almost died from the boiling flat
Two miles outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was dancin' in the Flamingo Club
And I was passing by, so I stopped in for a beer
I just kept starin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there right behind my chair
Touchin' me, said "You know, it ain't no accident that you came"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoes
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove
Wearin' a dress made out of stars and stripes
"Thought you'd never say hello", she said
"You know, you look like you could be the silent type"
And she opened up the Bible
And she started quoting it to me
Jeremiah, chapter 17,
From verses 21 and 33
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
There was revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of her froze
She had to sell everything she owned
Even her jewellery and her clothes
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm going on back again
I got to get to her and be brave
All the people we used to know
At least the ones that ain't in the grave
Some are bricklayers, some are bank robbers,
Some are burglars and some are truck drivers' wives
I don't know how it all got started
I have no idea what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point, different point of
view
Tangled up in blue.

/ Bob Dylan

Early one morning the sun was shining
And he was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said that their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's home-made dress,
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough
He was standing at the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the old East coast
Radio blasting the news
Straight on through
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when they first met
To a man four times her age
He left her penniless in a state of regret
It was time to bust out of the cage
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
Splitting up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
Saying "I wish I could tell you all the things"
"That I never learned to say"
He said "That's alright, baby, I love you too"
But we were tangled up in blue

He had a steady job and a pretty face
And everything seemed to fit
One day he could just feel the waste
He put it all down and split
And he drifted down to New Orleans
Where they treated him like a boy
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge
He nearly drowned in Delacroix
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He had one too many lovers and
None of them were too refined
All except for you
But you were tangled up in blue

She was working in the blinding light
And I stopped in for a drink
I just kept looking at her face so white
I didn't know what to think
Later on when the crowd thinned out
I was getting ready to leave
She was standing there right beside my chair
Saying "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
I said "Nothing baby, and that's for sure"
She leaned down into my face
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
As she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was snow all winter and no heat
Revolution was in the air
And one day all of his slaves ran free
Something inside of him died
The only thing I could do was be me
And get on that train and ride
And when it all came crashing down
I was already south
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round
I had the worst taste in my mouth
That I ever knew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again
Maybe tomorrow or maybe next year
I gotta find someone among the women and men
Whose destiny is unclear
Some are masters of illusion
Some are ministers of the trade
All of the strong delusion
All of their beds are unmade
Me I'm still heading towards the sun
Trying to stay out of the joint
We always did love the very same one
We just saw her from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue

other Bible references in other songs for another thread.

Is itcertain thechapter and verses keep changing, or are
they tricky to hear?

I do not quote, as I have no English Book.
Think it would be pretty senseless too. Of course, here are some of the
themes Dylan loves, but then again, three quarts of the Bible would
provide
them, wouldn't it?

Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over her shoulder
We'll meet again some day
On the avenue
Tangled up in Blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all thatmuch
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen alot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me Don't I know your name
I muttered something undernaeth my breath
She studdied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
Then open up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
>From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
>From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started dealing in slaves
And something inside of died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when the bottom finally feel out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again
I got to get to her some how
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters wives
Don'ty know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue.

These are the lyrics to the version on
the "Real Live" album:

Early one morning, the sun was shining.
He was laying in bed.
wondering if she changed at all,
if her hair was still red.
Her folks they said that thier lives together
sure was gonna be rough.
They never did like mama's homemade dress,
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And he was standing on the side of the road
rain falling on his shoes,
heading out for the lone east coast,
radio blasting the news
straight on through
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when they first met,
to a man 4 times her age.
He left her penniless, in the state of regret,
it was time to break out of the cage.
They drove that car as far as they could,
abandoned it out west.
splitting up on a dark, sad night,
both agreeing that it was best.
And she turned around to look at him
as he was walking away.
She said I wish I could tell you all the things
that I never learned how to say.
He said thats alright babe I love you too,
but we were tangled up in blue.

He had a steady job and a pretty face,
and everything seemed to fit.
One day he could just feel the waste,
he put it all down and split.
And he headed down to New Orleans,
where they treated him like a boy.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge,
he nearly drowned in Delacroix(sp).
And all the time he was alone,
the past was close behind.
he had one too many lovers then,
and none of them were too refined,
all except for you,
but you were tangled up in blue.

She was working in the blinding light,
and I stopped in for a drink.
I just kept looking at her face so white,
I didn't know what to think.
Later on as the crowd thinned out,
I was getting ready to leave.
She was standing there, beside my chair,
saying "Whats that you got up your sleeve?"
I said "nothing baby, and thats for sure"
She leaned down into my face.
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
as she bent down to tie the lases
of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with him on Montague street
in a basement down the stairs.
There was snow all winter and no heat,
revolution was in the air.
Then one day all his slaves ran free,
something inside of him died.
The only thing I could do was be me,
and get on that train and ride.
And it all came crashing down,
I was already south.
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round,
I had the worst tast in my mouth,
that I ever knew,
Tangled up in blue.

Now I'm going back again,
maybe tommorow, maybe next year.
I've got to find someone among the women and men
whose destiny is unclear.
Some are ministers of illusion,
some are masters of the trade.
All under strong delusion,
all of their beds are unmade.
Me I'm heading toward the sun,
trying to stay out of the joint.
We always did love the very same one.
We just saw her from a different point
of view,
Tangled up in blue.

They sat together in the park.
As the evening sky grew dark.
She look at him and he felt a spark,
Tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone,
And wished that he'd gone straight.
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked along by the old canal.
A little confused I remember well.
Stopped into a strange hotel,
With the neon burning bright.
He felt the heat of the night,
Hit him like a frieght,
Train moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxaphone someplace far off played.
As she was walking down by the arcade.
As the light burst through a beat up shade,
Were he was waking up.
She dropped a coin into the cup,
Of a blind man at the gate.
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up the room was bare.
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he did not care,
Threw the window open wide.
He felt an emptyness inside,
To which he just could not relate.
Bought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks.
And walks along with a parrot that talks.
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks,
Were the saliors all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again.
How long must he wait?
Once again for a simple twist of fate.

People tell you its a sin.
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin,
But I lost the ring.
She was born in spring,
But I was born to late.
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

Bob Dylan

Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off of my feet
nd I'm back in the rain, oooh and you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

Bird on the horizon sittin' on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oooh singin' just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singin' through these tears

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh but what a shame that all we've shared can't last
I can change I swear, woooa see what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

Love is so simple to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oooh in somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way

A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream
I'm going out of my mind, oooh with a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart

Bob Dylan

Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn't believe after all these years
You didn't know me better than that, sweet lady

Chorus #1:
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads headin' south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I ran into the fortune teller, who said beware of lightning that might
strike
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's
like There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar
door
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done
In the final end he won the war after losin' every battle

I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with
lies
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my
heart
Now everything's a little upside down
As a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What's good is bad, what's bad is good
You'll find out when you reach the top, you're on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed
Your eyes don't look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees
While the springtime turned slowly into autumn

Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You're an idiot, babe, it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else
instead Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory

I been double crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline
Which separated you from me
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We're idiots, babe, it's a wonder we can even feed ourselves

(Bob Dylan)

I've seen love go by my door, it's never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
've been shooting in the dark too long, when something's not right, it's
wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above, I've only known careless love
It always has hit me from below
But this time 'round it's more correct, right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne Lace, crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of, you might be spoiling me too much,
love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever, and never realize the time

Situations have ended sad, relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare all those scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking to

I look for you in old Honolulu, San Francisco, Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I'll see you in the sky above, in the tall grass and the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Bob Dylan

Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabashaw
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabashaw
Honey we could be in Kansas
By the time the snow begins to thaw

They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
Honey you wouldn't know it by me
Every day's been darkness since you've been gone

Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Well I feel just like that rooster
Honey you treat me so unkind

Well I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fire from above
Well I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fire from above
Well you know I even outrun the hound dog
Honey you know I earned your love

Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
Look at the sun sinkin' like a ship
Ain't that just like my heart babe
When you kiss my lips


The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall,
The cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall.
The curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down,
Anyone with any sense had already left town.
He was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts.

He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their
heads.
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.

Backstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs,
Lily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair.
Outside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide,
A gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside.
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.

Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
He made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine.
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.

Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
She slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown.
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
"Sorry, darlin', that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear.
He was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts.

"I know I've seen that face before," Big Jim was thinkin' to himself,
"Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf."
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
Starin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.

Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she
smiled.
She'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.
But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.

The hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
The drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king.
No, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.

Rosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife,
She was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's
wife.
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
Was lookin' to do just one good deed before she died.
She was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.

Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.
"Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you must
have known it would someday.
Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint,
I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint."
Down the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts.

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.
"There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the
air."
He went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk,
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.

Lily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,
She forgot all about the man she couldn't stand who hounded her so much.
"I've missed you so," she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts.

No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked.
And Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised,
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.
She was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts.

Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a
haul.
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town.
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.

The next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black,
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
The hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink.
The only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts.

The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, "Closed for repair,"
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
She was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
Thinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law.
But, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts.

Bob Dylan

If you see her say hello, she might be in Tangiers
She left here last early spring, is living there I hear
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her
Don't tell her it isn't so

We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
I always have respected her, for doin' what she did and gettin free
Whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on
>From the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people, as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Maybe I'm too sensitive, or else I'm gettin' soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, it all went by so fast
If she's goin' by this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time


'Twas in another life time,
One of toil and blood.
When blackness was a virtue
And the road was full of mud.
I came in from the wilderness,
A creature void of form.
"Come in" she said,
"I'll give you,
Shelter from the storm."

And if I pass this way again,
You can rest assured,
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word.
In a world of steel eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm,
Come in she said,
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm.

Not a word was spoke between us.
There was little risk involved.
everything up to that point,
Had been left unresolved.
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm.

I was burned out from exhaustion
I was buried in the hail.
Poisoned in the bushes
An' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile,
Ravaged in the corn
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm

Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair.
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
Come in she said
I'll give you,
Shelter from the storm.

Now there's a wall between us
Something has been lost.
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that all began
On an uneventfull morn
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm

Well the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm

I've heard newborn babies wailin'
Like a mornin' dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love.
Do I understand your question, man
Is it hopeless and forlorn.
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm.

In a little hill top village
I gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And they gave me a leathal dose.
I offered up my innocence
And got repaid with scorn
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm

Well I'm livin' in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line.
Beauty walk a razors edge,
Someday I'll make it mine.
If I could only turn the clock back
To when God and her were born
Come in she said
I'll give you
Shelter from the storm.

Bob Dylan

Buckets of rain, buckets of tears
Got all them buckets coming out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love honey baby I can stand

I've been meek, and hard like an oak
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me, honey baby I'll be here

I like the smile in your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery

Little red wagon, little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I'm taking you with me honey baby when I go

Life is sad, life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do, and you do it well
I'll do it for you, honey baby can't you tell?

I plan it all and I take my place
You break your promise all over the place
You promised to love me, but what do I see
Just you comin' and spillin' juice over me
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again

Now, you take your file and you bend my head
I never can remember anything that you said
You promised to love me, but what do I know
You're always spillin' juice on me like you got someplace to go
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again

Now, I've had enough, my box is clean
You know what I'm sayin' and you know what I mean
From now on you'd best get on someone else
While you're doin' it, keep that juice to yourself
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again



Well, that big dumb blonde
With her wheel in the gorge
And Turtle, that friend of theirs
With his checks all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk
With his cheese in the cash
They're all gonna be there
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Ev'rybody from right now
To over there and back
The louder they come
The harder they crack
Come now, sweet cream
Don't forget to flash
We're all gonna meet
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I took my counselor
Out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there
She told him a yarn
Then along came Jones
Emptied the trash
Ev'rybody went down
To that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I'm hittin' it too hard
My stones won't take
I get up in the mornin'
But it's too early to wake
First it's hello, goodbye
Then push and then crash
But we're all gonna make it
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I looked at my watch
I looked at my wrist
Punched myself in the face
With my fist
I took my potatoes
Down to be mashed
Then I made it over
To that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

(Words and Music by J. R. Robertson)

Stranded out in the night, Eliza took me down,
To see the window give rain to the town.
Its against the law to be a tonic man,
But the window knows shes got the upper hand.
So I went on in feelin kind a wheezy,
You know she soothed my mind boys.
She rocked me kind a slow and easy
All day and all night.

Pick a card before you go, Its a long trip to Mexico.
Eliza waited by the door.
I cant stay here anymore, no, no.
Then she took a pill, she washed her feet in the mud,
She said Look out, son, you know I just ordered a flood,
For forty days and forty nights.

Then I dropped my shoes, Eliza called my name.
She said it looked to her like its gonna rain.
Then the cotton king came in chokin
And the window laughed and said, I aint jokin.
Back against the wall, she said. Now dont you tease me.
I just fell in love, boy, so rock me kinda slow and kinda easy
All day and all night.

Sweet William said, with a drunken head,
If I had a boat, Id help yall float.
Eliza stood there watchin William in a trance;
As the window did the St. Vitus dance.
But just then an old man with a boat named Breezy
Said, You can ride with Clyde, boys, if you rock it kinda slow and easy
All day and all night.


I'm going down to Rose Marie's
She never does me wrong.
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song.

It's a wicked life but what the hell
The stars ain't falling down.
I'm standing outside the Taj Mahal
I don't see no one around.

Goin' to Acapulco
Goin' on the run.
Goin' down to see fat gut
Goin' to have some fun.
Yeah
Goin' to have some fun.

Now, whenever I get up
And I ain't got what I see
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
'Bout a quarter after three.

There are worse ways of getting there
And I ain't complainin' none.
If the clouds don't drop and the train don't stop
I'm bound to meet the sun.

Goin' to Acapulco
Goin' on the run.
Goin' down to see some girl
Goin' to have some fun.
Yeah
Goin' to have some fun.

Now, if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks.
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks.

Well, sometime you know when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some.
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waitin' for me to come.

Goin' to Acapulco
Goin' on the run.
Goin' down to see some girl
Goin' to have some fun.
Yeah
Goin' to have some fun.

(Words and Music by J. R. Robertson and R. Manuel)

Katies been gone since the spring time;
She wrote one time n sent her love.
Katies been gone for such a long time now.
I wonder what kind of love shes thinkin of.

Dear Katie,
If you can hear me,
I cant wait to have ya near me.

Oh, Katie, since ya caught that bus,
Well, I just dont know how things are with us.
Im still here and youre out there.

Katie laughed when I said I was lonely.
She said, Theres no need t feel that way.
Katie said that I was her only one,
But then I wonder why she didnt wanna stay.

Dear Katie, is Im the only one,
How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, wont ya tell me straight:
How much longer do I have to wait?

Ill believe you,
But please come through.
I know its wrong to be apart this long;
You should be here, near me.

Katies been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
Shes gone to find some newer places,
Left the old life far behind.
Dear Katie, dont ya miss your home?
I dont see why you had to roam.

Dear Katie, since youve been away
I lose a little something every day
I need you here, but youre still out there.
Dear Katie, please drop me a line,
just write, Love, to tell me youre fine.

Oh, Katie, if you can hear me,
I just cant wait to have you near me.
I can only think
Where are you,
What ya do, may be theres some one new.


I pulled out for San Anton',
I never felt so good.
My woman said she'd meet me there
And of course, I knew she would.
The coachman, he hit me for my hook
And he asked me my name.
I give it to him right away,
Then I hung my head in shame.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

I come into Pittsburgh
At six-thirty flat.
I found myself a vacant seat
An' I put down my hat.
"What's the matter, Molly, dear,
What's the matter with your mound?"
"What's it to ya, Moby Dick?
This is chicken town!"
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

I bought my girl
A herd of moose,
One she could call her own.
Well, she came out the very next day
To see where they had flown.
I'm goin' down to Tennessee,
Get me a truck 'r somethin'.
Gonna save my money and rip it up!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!

Now, I come in on a ferris wheel
An' boys, I sure was slick.
I come in like a ton of bricks,
Laid a few tricks on 'em.
Goin' back to Pittsburgh,
Count up to thirty,
Round that horn and ride that herd,
Gonna thread up!
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Lookin' for my lo and behold,
Get me outa here, my dear man!



After a while we took in the clothes,
Nobody said very much.
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
Which nobody really wanted to touch.
Mama come in and picked up a book
An' Papa asked her what it was.
Someone else asked, "What do you care?"
Papa said, "Well, just because."
Then they started to take back their clothes,
Hang 'em on the line.
It was January the thirtieth
And everybody was feelin' fine.

The next day everybody got up
Seein' if the clothes were dry.
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,
Mama, of course, she said, "Hi!"
"Have you heard the news?" he said, with a grin,
"The Vice-President's gone mad!"
"Where?" "Downtown." "When?" "Last night."
"Hmm, say, that's too bad!"
"Well, there's nothin' we can do about it," said the neighbor,
"It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget."
"Yes, I guess so," said Ma,
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.

I reached up, touched my shirt,
And the neighbor said, "Are those clothes yours?"
I said, "Some of 'em, not all of 'em."
He said, "Ya always help out around here with the chores?"
I said, "Sometime, not all the time."
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as papa yelled outside,
"Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes."
Well, I just do what I'm told,
So, I did it, of course.
I went back in the house and Mama met me
And then I shut all the doors.

Well, I've already had two beers
I'm ready for the broom
Please, Missus Henry, won't you
Take me to my room?
I'm a good ol' boy
But I've been sniffin' too many eggs
Talkin' to too many people
Drinkin' too many kegs
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
Please, Missus Henry, Missus Henry, please!
I'm down on my knees
An' I ain't got a dime

Well, I'm groanin' in a hallway
Pretty soon I'll be mad

I'm down on my knees
An' I ain't got a dime


We carried you in our arms
On Independence Day,
And now you'd throw us all aside
And put us on our way.
Oh what dear daughter 'neath the sun
Would treat a father so,
To wait upon him hand and foot
And always tell him, "No"?
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so alone
And life is brief.

We pointed out the way to go
And scratched your name in sand,
Though you just thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand.
Now, I want you to know that while we watched,
You discover there was no one true.
Most ev'rybody really thought
It was a childish thing to do.
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief.

It was all very painless
When you went out to receive
All that false instruction
Which we never could believe.
And now the heart is filled with gold
As if it was a purse.
But, oh, what kind of love is this
Which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief,
Must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know
We're so low
And life is brief.

Disc 2 (37:43)


Now, too much of nothing
Can make a man feel ill at ease.
One man's temper might rise
While another man's temper might freeze.
In the day of confession
We cannot mock a soul.
Oh, when there's too much of nothing,
No one has control.

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Send them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

Too much of nothing
Can make a man abuse a king.
He can walk the streets and boast like most
But he wouldn't know a thing.
Now, it's all been done before,
It's all been written in the book,
But when there's too much of nothing,
Nobody should look.

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Send them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion

Too much of nothing
Can turn a man into a liar,
It can cause one man to sleep on nails
And another man to eat fire.
Ev'rybody's doin' somethin',
I heard it in a dream,
But when there's too much of nothing,
It just makes a fella mean.

Say hello to Valerie
Say hello to Vivian
Send them all my salary
On the waters of oblivion


Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus.
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread

It's a one-track town, just brown, and a breeze, too,
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're headin' out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit.
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout

Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle.
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it.
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells.
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby
Take me down to California, baby

Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus.
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day, with a nose full of pus.
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread
Yea! Heavy and a bottle of bread


.17. Ruben Remus (3:13)
(Words and Music by J. R. Robertson and R. Manuel)

Wrote a letter this mornin,
Put it in your hat;
Cause theres none t read it
And I know you knew that.
I bought a joke, a trick or two
Just to bring and show you
Caught ya with the trickster, too.
Sometimes I wonder how ya knew
A hypnotist, a fancy talker,
Ruben Remus aint no doctor.

I knew the man, I tried to remember
Just where it was Id seen his face.
Long ago, in a movie show,
He looked like that man singin bass,
Knew him by his nursry rhyme,
The story of the rabbit man,
Fell right in an said to him
Id like to help you if I can,
I know the film would only shock her
Ruben Remus aint no doctor.

He only needed what you had
Asked for nothing more
Said hed like to take you on,
But its been done before
Ya couldnt see hes a travlin man
And he cannot take your hand
Its very hard to understand
Why his sons were never banned
I know the man would never knock her,
Ruben Remus aint no doctor.

No one seen ya since hes been gone
Its been a day, maybe more,
I took a walk in you yard
And knocked on your back door,
Why wont you let me in?
Im not the one who did ya in
Is Mr. Remus still your friend?
You say you dont remember him
Turn me down, would ya,
Well, Ive got new for you
Ruben Remus aint no doctor.


Well you can tell ev'rybody
Down in ol' Frisco
Tell 'em
Tiny Montgomery says hello

Now ev'ry boy and girl's
Gonna get their bang
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's
Gonna shake that thing
Tell ev'rybody
Down in ol' Frisco
That Tiny Montgomery's comin'
Down to say hello

Skinny Moo and
Half-track Frank
They're gonna both be gettin'
Outa the tank
One bird book
And a buzzard and a crow
Tell 'em all
That Tiny's gonna say hello

Scratch your dad
Do that bird
Suck that pig
And bring it on home
Pick that drip
And bake that dough
Tell 'em all
That Tiny says hello

Now he's king of the drunks
An' he squeezes, too
Watch out, Lester
Take it, Lou
Join the monks
The C.I.O.
Tell 'em all
That Tiny Montgomery says hello

Now grease that pig
And sing praise
Go on out
And gas that dog
Trick on in
Honk that stink
Take it on down
And watch it grow
Play it low
And pick it up
Take it on in
In a plucking cup
Three-legged man
And a hot-lipped hoe
Tell 'em all
Montgomery says hello

Well you can tell ev'rybody
Down in ol' Frisco
Tell 'em all
Montgomery says hello



Don't ya tell Henry,
Apple's got your fly.

I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
A-lookin' around just to see who's born.
I found a little chicken down on his knees,
I went up and yelled to him,
"Please, please, please!"
He said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Apple's got your fly."

I went down to the corner at a-half past ten,
I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when.
I looked down low, I looked above,
And who did I see but the one I love.
She said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Apple's got your fly."

Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
A-lookin' around just to see myself.
I spotted a horse and a donkey, too,
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
They said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Apple's got your fly."

Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night,
A-lookin' around, it was outa sight.
I looked high and low for that big ol' tree,
I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me.
I said, "Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Don't ya tell Henry,
Apple's got your fly."


Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you,
Not out of spite or anger
But simply because it's true.
Now, I hope you won't object to this,
Giving back all of what you owe,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The sooner you can go.

Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take heed of this and get plenty of rest.

Nothing was delivered
But I can't say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be,
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Now you must provide some answers
For what you sell has not been received,
And the sooner you come up with them,
The sooner you can leave.

Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take heed of this and get plenty rest.

(Now you know)
Nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made ev'rybody pay.
No, nothing was delivered,
Yes, 'n' someone must explain
That as long as it takes to do this
Then that's how long that you'll remain.

Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take heed of this and get plenty rest.


Now, there's a certain thing
That I learned from Jim
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And that is that there's a certain way
That a man must swim
If he expects to live off
Of the fat of the land.
Open the door, Homer,
I've heard it said before.
Open the door, Homer,
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

Now, there's a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
A fella who always blushes
And that is that ev'ryone
Must always flush out his house
If he don't expect to be
Goin' 'round housing flushes.
Open the door, Homer,
I've heard it said before.
Open the door, Homer,
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

"Take care of all your memories"
Said my friend, Mick
"For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them."
Open the door, Homer,
I've heard it said before.
Open the door, Homer,
I've heard it said before

But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.


Long-distance operator,
Place this call, it's not for fun.
Long-distance operator,
Please, place this call, you know it's not for fun.
I gotta get a message to my baby,
You know, she's not just anyone.

There are thousands in the phone booth,
Thousands at the gate.
There are thousands in the phone booth,
Thousands at the gate.
Ev'rybody wants to make a long-distance call
But you know they're just gonna have to wait.

If a call comes from Louisiana,
Please, let it ride.
If a call comes from Louisiana,
Please, let it ride.
This phone booth's on fire,
It's getting hot inside.

Ev'rybody wants to be my friend,
But nobody wants to get higher.
Ev'rybody wants to be my friend,
But nobody wants to get higher.
Long-distance operator,
I believe I'm stranglin' on this telephone wire.


If your mem'ry serves you well,
We were goin' to meet again and wait,
So I'm goin' to unpack all my things
And sit before it gets too late.
No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell,
But you know that we shall meet again
If your mem'ry serves you well.
This wheel's on fire,
Rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin,
This wheel shall explode!

If your mem'ry serves you well,
I was goin' to confiscate your lace,
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot
And hide it in your case.
If I knew for sure that it was yours . . .
But it was oh so hard to tell.
But you knew that we would meet again,
If your mem'ry serves you well.
This wheel's on fire,
Rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin,
This wheel shall explode!

If your mem'ry serves you well,
You'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done.
And after ev'ry plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell,
You knew that we would meet again,
If your mem'ry served you well.
This wheel's on fire,
Rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin,
This wheel shall explode!






Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood,
Cries out, "My God, they killed them all!"
Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Three bodies lyin' there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin' around mysteriously.
"I didn't do it," he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin' the register, I hope you understand.
I saw them leavin'," he says, and he stops
"One of us had better call up the cops."
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night.

Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around.
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that.
In Paterson that's just the way things go.
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
'Less you wanna draw the heat.

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops.
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin' around
He said, "I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates."
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head.
Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead"
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men.

Four in the mornin' and they haul Rubin in,
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs.
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin' eye
Says, "Wha'd you bring him in here for? He ain't the guy!"
Yes, here's the story of the Hurricane,
The man the authorities came to blame
For somethin' that he never done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame,
Rubin's in South America, fightin' for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin' the screws to him, lookin' for somebody to blame.
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
"Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night?"
"Don't forget that you are white."

Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
Cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talkin' to your friend Bello
Now you don't wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
You'll be doin' society a favor.
That sonofabitch is brave and gettin' braver.
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no Gentleman Jim."

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
It's my work, he'd say, and I do it for pay
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail.
But then they took him to the jail house
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse.

All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance.
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger.
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger.
And though they could not produce the gun,
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed.

Rubin Carter was falsely tried.
The crime was murder "one," guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game.

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell.
That's the story of the Hurricane,
But it won't be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done.
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world.


I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unkown country where I could not go wrong

I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the centre of town
So I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went into a laundry to wash my clothes down

A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said "Are you lookin' for something easy to catch?"
I said "I ain't got no money," He said "That ain't necessary".

We set out that night for the cold in the North.
I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word
I said, "Where are we goin'?" He said we'd be back by the fourth.
I said "That's the best news I ever heard."

I was thinking about turquiose I was thinking about gold.
I was thhinking about diamonds and the worlds biggest necklace.
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold,
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless.

How she told me that one day we'd meet up again,
And thing would be different the next time we wed.
If I only hang on and just be her friend.
I still can't remember all the best things she said.

We came to the pyramids all embedde in ice.
He said "There's a body I'm trying to find,
If I carry it out it'll fetch a good price."
Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind.

The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous.
We chopped throught he night and we chopped throught he dawn.
When he died I was hopong that it wasn't contagious,
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.

I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There were no jewels no nothing, I felt I'd been had.
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly,
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad

I picked up his body and I dragged it inside,
Threw down into the hole and I put back the cover.
I said a quick prayer and I felt satified
Then I rode back to Isis just to tell her I love her.

She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise.
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed.
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes.
I cursed one time then rode on ahead.

She said "Where ya been?" I said "No place special."
She said "You look different." I said "Well I guess."
She said "You been gone." I said "That's only natural."
She said "You gonna stay." I said "Well if you want me to yes."

Isis oh Isis you're a mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizziling rain.


I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.
It's very nice to stay a week or two.

There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance.

Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land.

And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it's so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.

Bob Dylan and Jacques Levy

Your Breath is sweet, your eyes are like
Two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie.
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love.
Your loyalty is not me but to the stars above

Chourus :
One more cup of coffee for the road.
One more cup of coffee for I go,
To the valley below.

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade.
He'll teach you how to pick an choose
And how to throw the blade.
And he oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude.
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

Chorus

Your sister sees the future
Like your momma and yourself.
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf.
And your pleasure know no limits
Your voice is like a meadow larks.
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark.

Chours


Oh sister when I come, to ly in your arms.
You should not treat me like a stranger.
Our father would not like the way that you act,
And you must realize the danger.
Oh sister am I not a brother to you.
And one deserving of affection.
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow his direction.
We grew up together from the cradle to the grave.
We died and were reborn and left mysteriously saved
Oh sister when I come to knock on your door
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean, but it ends at the shore.
You may not see me tomorrow.


Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just
because."

Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last.
They called Joe "Crazy," the baby they called "Kid Blast."
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin' numbers too.
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue.

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at.
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof.
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinkin' he was bulletproof.

The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners.
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs.

The hostages were tremblin' when they heard a man exclaim,
"Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
But Joey stepped up, he raised his hand, said, "We're not those kind of
men.
It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with.
"What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met
"Five to ten," said Joey. The judge says, "That's exactly what you get."

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for tryin' to stop a strike.
His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.

When they let him out in '71 he'd lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great.
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
Why did they have to come and blow you away?

It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
"I'm around too many children," he'd say, "they should never know of one."
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe,
Emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."

One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it comin' through the door as he lifted up his fork.
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?

Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep.
I heard his best friend Frankie say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep."
Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.

The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
And someday if God's in heaven overlookin' His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.

Joey, Joey,
King of the streets, child of clay.
Joey, Joey,
What made them want to come and blow you away?


Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape,
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape.

Sold my guitar to the baker's son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide,
But I can get another one
And I'll play for Magdalena as we ride.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoofbeats like castanets on stone.
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon.

Was it me that shot him down in the cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what's done is done.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

At the corrida we'll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone.
We'll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torre6n.

Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town.
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You'll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown.

The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun.
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.

Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don't say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?

Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light.
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night.

No llores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango.
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango.


Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothin' like that.
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind.
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay.

As the mornin' light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.
"Pardon, monsieur," the desk clerk says,
Carefully removes his fez,
"Am I hearin' you right?"
And as the yellow fog is liftin'
The Greek is quickly headin' for the second floor.
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinkin' he's the Soviet Ambassador,
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay.

A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doin' business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,
"Can you see anything?"
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,
Says, "Open up another deck."
But the dealer says, "Attendez-vous, s'il vous plalt,''
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay.

The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.
He tried to grab the woman's hand,
Said, "Here's a ring, it cost a grand."
She said, "That ain't enough."
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,
Where a handwritten sign read, "Do Not Disturb."
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay.

"I've got to talk to someone quick!"
But the Greek said, "Go away," and he kicked the chair to the floor.
He hung there from the chandelier.
She cried, "Help, there's danger near
Please open up the door!"
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love.
But the desk clerk said, "It happens every day,"
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay.

As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.
The dealer said, "It's too late now.
You can take your money, but I don't know how
You'll spend it in the tomb."
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,
"My darling, je vous aime beaucoup."
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay.

I was sittin' home alone one night in L.A.,
Watchin' old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothin' but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes.
Didn't seem like much was happenin',
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.
Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear
And there's really nothin' anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay.

Bob Dylan

I laid on a dune
I looked at the sky
When the children were babies
And played on the beach
You came up to behind me
I saw you go by
You were always so close
and still within' reach
Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change you mind
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define.

I can still see them playin'
With their pails in the sand
They run to the water
Their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells
Fallin' out of their hands
As they follow each other
Back up the hill
Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife

Sleepin' in the woods
By a fire in the night
Drinkin' white rum
In a Portugal bar
Them playin' leap-frog
And hearin' about Snow White
You in the market place
In Savanna-la-Mar
Sara, Sara
It's all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, Sara
Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret

I can still hear the sounds
Of those Methodist bells
I'd taken the cure
And had just gotten through
Stayin' up for days
In the Chelsea Hotel
Writin' "Sad-Eyed Lady
Of the Lowlands" for you
Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we're never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

How did I meet you
I don't know
A messenger sent me
In a tropical storm
You were there in the winter
Moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane
When the weather was warm
Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness

Now the beach is deserted
Except for some kelp
And a peice of an old ship
That lies on the shore
You always responded
When I needed your help
You gimme a map
And a key to your door
Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go




Hard Rain

At Budokan

You got a tight connection to my heart
You got a tight connection to my heart
You got a tight connection to my heart
You got a tight connection to my heart

Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn't with you around my neck
I said I'd send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet.
I'll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out.
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about.
Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget.

I'm gonna get my coat.
I feel the breath of a storm.
There's something I've got to do tonight,
You go inside and stay warm.

Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
I don't know.
Has anybody seen my love?

You want to talk to me.
Go ahead and talk.
Whatever you got to say to me
Won't come as any shock.
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep.
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep.
She said, "Be easy baby.
There ain't nothing worth stealin' in here"

You're the one I've been looking for
You're the one that's got the key
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
Or you're too good for me

Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,

Has anybody seen my love?

Well they're not showing any lights tonight
And there's no moon.
There's just a hot blooded singer
Singing "Memphis in June"
And they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Later he'll be shot for
Resisting arrest.
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness.
What looks large from a distance
Close up ain't never that big.

I never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
I never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mine.

Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
Has anybody seen my love,
I don't know
Has anybody seen my love?

Talkin' 'bout a .....
Talkin' 'bout a .....
Talkin' 'bout a .....
You got a tight connection to my heart
You got a tight connection to my heart
You got a tight connection to my heart


Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down
But it looks like it don't.
I'd like to get you to change your mind
But it looks like you won't

From now on I'll be busy.
Ain't goin' nowhere fast.
I'm just glad it's over
I'm seeing the real you at last.

Well, I risked my neck for you,
Didn't I take chances?
Didn't I rise above it all for you,
The most unfortunate circumstances?

Well, I have had some rotten nights,
Didn't think that they would pass.
I'm just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last.

I'm hungry and I'm irritable
And I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix.

Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast,
But now the time has come
And I'm seeing the real you at last.

When I met you baby,
You didn't show no visible scars.
You could ride like Annie Oakley,
You could shoot like Belle Starr.

Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble,
Trouble always comes to pass,
All I care about now
Is that I'm seeing the real you at last.

Well, I'm gonna quit this baby talk now,
I guess I should have known.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles,
I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.

Whatever you gonna do,
Please do it fast.
I'm still trying to get used to
Seeing the real you at last.


I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest,
You to me were true,
You to me were the best.
When there is no more,
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you.

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail.
I had so much left to do.
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen'm
One time or two.
When the roses fade,
And I'm in the shade,
I'll remember you.

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through,
It was you who understood.
Though I'd never say
That I'd done it the way
That you'd have liked me to.
In the end,
My dear sweet friend,
I'll remember you.


Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That's what they did

They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his

They took a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out him
That's what they did

He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

He was a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out of him
That's what they did

He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out him
That's what they did

They said, "Listen boy, you're just a pup"
They sent to a napalm health spa to shape up

They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills,
A jeep to drive, blood to spill

They said "Congratulations you got what it takes".
They sent him back into the rat-race without any brakes

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out him
That's what they did

He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
Only game he could play was Russian roulette

He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed

He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool

They took a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That's what they did

He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or a bar
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star

He was wearing boxing gloves, he took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay

His mama walks the floor, his dadddy weeps and moans
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own

They took a clean-cut kid
And made a killer out of him
That's what they did

Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust
All he ever wanted was someone he could trust

They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about

He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire

They took a clean-cut kid
And they made a killer out him
That's what they did.


Now you're here beside me, baby,
You're a living dream.
And every time you get this close
It makes me want to scream.
You touched me and you knew
That I was warm for you and then,
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

Sorry if I hurt you, baby,
Sorry if I did.
sorry if I touched the place
Where your secrets are hid.
But you meant more than everything
And I could not pretend.
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

You give me something to think about, baby,
Every time I see ya.
Don't worry baby, I don't mind leaving,
I'd just like it to be my idea.

You taught me how to love you, baby,
And you taught me, oh, so well.
Now, I can't go back to what was, baby.
I can't unring the bell.
You took my reality
And cast it to the wind
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.


Trust yourself,
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best.
Trust yourself,
Trust yourself to do what's right and not be second-guessed.
Don't trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust.
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

Trust yourself,
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end.
Trust yourself,
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when.
Don't trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.

Well, you're on your own, you always were.
In a land of wolves and thieves.
Don't put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes.

Trust yourself
And you won't be disappointed when vain people let you down.
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found.
Don't trust me to show you love
When my love may only be lust.
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself.


Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun.
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors.
But I will always be emotionally yours.

Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart.
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start.
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for.
And I will always be emotionally yours.

It's like my whole life never happened,
When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought.
I know this dream, it might be crazy,
But it's the only one I've got.

Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied.
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores.
But I will always be emotionally yours.


Look out across the fields, see me returning.
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile.
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You've had time to think about it for a while.

Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over.
Its the end of the chase and the moon is high.
It won't matter who loves who.
You'll love me or I'll love you
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting.
Sorrow covers you up like a cape.
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.

Well, I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You'll know all about it, love.
It'll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river.
You must have been protecting someone last time I called.
I've never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver.
I've never asked to set yourself up for a fall.

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
For the love of a lousy buck, I've watched them die.
Stick around, baby, we're not through,
Don't look for me, I'll see you.
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection.
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line.
I don't want to be a fool starving for affection.
I don't want to drown in someone else's wine.

For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that's howling in your eye.
You will seek me and you'll find
Me in the wasteland of your mind.
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support.
This time tomorrow I'll know you better.
Where my memory is not so short.

This time I'm asking for freedom,
Freedom from a world which you deny.
And you'll give it to me now,
I'll take it anyhow.
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.


Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair
Are you still my friend, baby, show me a sign
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?

You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file
What's your position, baby, what's going on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

I know everything about this place, or so it seems
Am I know longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed
What's happening baby to make you act so strange?

Something is burning, baby, here's what I say
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today
I see the shadow of a man, baby, makin' you blue
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?

We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?

I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night, when I think of
you
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light, and it's got to be
true
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied

Got to start someplace baby, can you explain?
Please don't fade away on me baby, like the midnight train
Answer me baby, a casual look will do
Just what in the world has come over you?

I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind, and it's upside down
I can feel it in the dust as I get of the bus on the outskirts of town
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you
deserve.

Something is burning, baby, something's in flames
There's a man going round calling names
Ring down when your ready, baby, I'm waiting for you
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.


Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside.
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide.
I live in another world where life and death are memorized.
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer.
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere.
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise.
Whom nature's beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes.
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I'm sure it is.
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognised.
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel.
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel.
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies.
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.




Knocked Out Loaded


Well I told my baby
I said "Baby, I know where you been
Well, I know who you are
And what league you played in"
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn.

Well, the night is so empty
So quit and still
For only fifteen hundred dollars
You can have anybody killed
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn.

Well, I told my baby
Further down the line
I said, "What happens tomorrow
Is on your head, not mine"
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn
You wanna ramble
To the break of dawn.


There was a man named Hatma Gandi
He would not bow down he would not fight
He knew the deal was down and dirty
And nothing wrong could make it right away
But he knew his duty and the prize he had to pay
Just another holy man who tried to be a friend
My God, they killed him.

Another man from Atlanta, Georgia
By name of Martin Luther King
He shook the land like the rolling thunder
And made the bells of freedom ring today
With a dream of beauty that they could not burn away
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand
My God, they killed him.

The only Son of God Almighty
The holy one called Jesus Christ
He healed the lame and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him.

There was a man named Mahatma Gandi
A man named Martin Luther King
The only Son of God Almighty
The only one called Jesus Christ
On the road to glory where the story never ends
Just the holy Son of Man we'll never understand
My God, they killed him.

I didn't know that you'd be a-leavin'
Who you thought you were talking to
I said to you maybe we're even
Or maybe I'm one up on you
I sent you all my money
Just like I did before
I try to reach you honey
But you're drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
I ain't gonna get lost in this current
I don't like playing cat and mouse
No gentleman likes making love to a servant
Especially when he's in his father's house
I never could guess your weight baby
Never needed to call you my whore
I always thought you were straight baby
But you're drifting too far from shore
Well, drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted
The bottom of the barrel is too
I waited years, sometimes, for what I wanted
Everybody can't be as lucky as you
Never no more do I wonder
Why you don't never play with me any more
And any moment you can go under
Cause you're drifting too far from shore

Yeah, drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore

You and me we had completeness
I'd give you all of what I could provide
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
We were the wrong side
I've already ripped out the phones, honey
You can't walk the streets in a war
I can finish this alone honey
You're drifting too far from shore


As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious memories sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appears
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious memories sacred scenes unfold.


Maybe someday you'll be satisfied when you've lost everything
You'll have nothing left to hide
When you're through running over things, like you're walking 'cross the
tracks
Maybe you'll beg me like a dog to take you back

Maybe someday you'll find out everybody's somebody's fool
Maybe then you'll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool
Maybe someday when you're by yourself alone
You'll only love that I have for you was never my own

Maybe someday you'll have nowhere to turn
You look back and wonder at the bridges you have burned
You look back sometime when the lights grew dim
And you'll see you look much better with me than you do with him

Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down
Maybe someday you will understand
That something for nothing is everybody's plan

Maybe someday you'll remember what you felt
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
When both of us baby, with those who some sort of a test
Neither one of us could do what we do best

I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough

Maybe someday you'll believe me when I say
That I wanted you baby in every kind of way

Maybe someday you'll hear a voice from on high saying
For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?
Forgive me baby for what I didn't do
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you

Always was a sucker for the right cross
Never wanted to go home the the last cent was lost
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me

Maybe someday there'll be nothing to tell
But I just as happy as you baby I just can't say it so well
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
It was no excuse for you to say that we don't think alike

You said you were going to Frisco, stay a couple of months
I always liked San Fransisco, I was there for a party once
Maybe someday you'll see that it's true,
There was no greater love than what I had for you


Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the
neck.

Well the Marshall, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp,
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath.
Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death.

Well I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in,
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
You know I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart.
The memory of you keeps callin' after me like a rollin' train.

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
I could never figure out why you choose that particular place to meet,
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect, as I got in behind the wheel.

Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
And we slept near the Alamo. your skin was so tender and soft.
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back,
I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get
blown off.

Well, we're driving this car and the sun is comin' up over the Rockies.
Now I know she ain't you but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in
her soul.
But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood any more to remember the
times when I was your only man.
And she don't want to remind me, she knows this car would go out of
control.

Brownsville Girl with your Brownsville curl,
Teeth like pearls, shining like the moon above.
Brownsville Girl show me all around the world.
Brownsville Girl, you're my honey love.

Well. we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live, he owned a wreckin' lot
outside of town, about a mile.
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back.
She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust, she said Henry ain't here,
but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while.

And she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinkin' of
bummin' a ride back to from where she started.
But she changed the subject every time money came up.
She said Welcome to land of the living dead, but you could tell she was so
broken-hearted.
She said Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt.

How far are you all going? Ruby asked us with a sigh.
We're going all the way 'till the wheels fall off and burn.
'till the sun peels off the paint and the seat covers fade and the water
moccasin dies. Ruby just smiled and said Ah, you know, some babies never
learn.

Something about that movie though, well I just can't get it out of my
head.
But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck and the way people
moved.
And a lot of them seemed to be looking my way.

Brownsville Girl with your Brownsville curl,
Teeth like pearls, shining like the moon above.
Brownsville Girl show me all around the world.
Brownsville Girl, you're my honey love.

Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour.
I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
I didn't know whether to duck or to run so I ran.
We've got him cornered in the churchyard I heard somebody shout.

Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune, underneath it said
'A man with no alibi'.
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
It was the best acting I saw anybody do.

I've always been the kind of person that does not like to trespass but
sometimes you just find yourself over the lines.
Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now!
You know I feel pretty good, but that ain't sayin' much,
I could feel a whole lot better, if you were just here by my side to show
me how.

Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory
Peck.
Yeah, but you know it's not the one that I had in mind.
He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about.
But I'll see him in anything. So I stand in line.

You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had'em planned.
The only thing we know for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn't
Henry Porter.
And you know there was something about you baby that I liked that was
always too good for this world.
Just like you always said there was something about me you liked that I
left in the French Quarter.

Strange how people who suffered together have stronger connections than
people who are most content.
I don't have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.
You always said people don't do what they believe in, they just do what's
most convenient, then they repent.
And I always said Hang on to me baby, and let's hope that the roof stays
on.

There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.
I don't remember who I was or where I was bound.
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck.
He wore a gun and he was shot in the back, seems like a long time ago,
long before the stars were torn down.

Brownsville Girl with your Brownsville curl,
Teeth like pearls, shining like the moon above.
Brownsville Girl show me all around the world.
Brownsville Girl, you're my honey love.


Don't ever try to change me I've been in this thing too long
There's nothing you can say or do to make me think I'm wrong
But I'm going off to Libya, there's a guy I gotta see
He's been living there three years now in an oil refinery
I got my mind made up Got my mind made up

Call you ma in Tallahassee, tell her her baby's on the line
Tell her not to worry, everything is gonna be fine
Well I'll give you all my money all my connections too
There ain't nothing in this world girl, you can say I didn't give to you
I got my mind made up Got my mind made up

You will be alright girl, someone's watching over you
He won't do nothing to you baby that I wouldn't do
Well if you don't want to see me look the other way
You don't have to feed me I ain't your dog that's gone astray
I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up
Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up


Something about you that I can't shake
Don't know how much more of this I can take
Baby, I'm under your spell

I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
When my last dream exploded I noticed your light
Baby, oh what a story I could tell

It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel

I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam
I'll call you tomorrow, if there's phones where I am
Baby, caught between heaven and hell

But I will be back, I will survive
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive
Baby, can't you tell?

Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell!

Everywhere you go it's enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
I trusted you baby, you can trust me now

Turn back baby, wipe your eye
Don't think I'm leaving here, without a kiss goodbye
Baby, is there anything left to tell?

I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head
Maybe next time I let the dead bury the dead
Baby, what more can I tell?

Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
Pray that I don't die of thirst
Baby, two feet from the well.




Down In The Groove

You know, we made a vow, not to leave one another, never.


When did you leave heaven ?
How could they let you go ?
How's every thing in heaven ?
I'd like to know.

Why did you trade heaven ?
For all these earthly things ?
Where on earth you hide halo ?
Where did you lose your wings ?

Have they missed you ?
Can you get back in ?
If I kiss you would it be a sin ?
I am only human but you are so divine.
When did you leave heaven angel mine ?


Look who's back in town
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown
All you boys better run for cover
If you don't a-wanna be a hearted broken lover.

See her in that very tight skirt
Got what it takes
Just to make you hurt
Don't you see by those big bright eyes
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies.

Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doin' them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine.

I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
Please let me love you, baby
Don't put me down.

Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doin' them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine.

I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
Please let me love you, baby
Don't put me down.


When you're sad and when you're lonely and you haven't got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you held sacred falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When you're standing on the cross-roads hat you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished and you don't know what's up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When the storm clouds gather round you and heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there's no one there to comfort you with a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

Oh, the tree of life is growing here the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines in dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire with the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find just one law abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end


I got to see you baby, I don't care
Maybe someday, baby, you say where
I had a dream about you baby, a dream about you baby
Late last night you come rolling across my mind

You got that crazy rhythm when you walk
You make me nervous when you start to talk
I had a dream about you baby, a dream about you baby
Late last night you come rolling across my mind

I see the highway, baby, flag me down
Say take me daddy to the nearest town
I had a dream about you baby, had a dream about you baby
Late last night you come rolling across my mind

The joint is jumpin', it's really somethin'
The beat is pumpin', the laugh is thumpin'
Spend my money, on you, honey
My hands are shaking and my mind is breaking

You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
You make me so mad, I tell you to stop
I had a dream about you baby, dream about you baby
Late last night you come rolling across my mind

The joint is jumpin', it's really somethin'
The beat is pumpin', the laugh is thumpin'
Spend my money, on you, honey
My hands are shaking and my mind is breaking

You wear a blue scarf above your head
With a long dress, fire engine red
I had a dream about you baby, dream about you baby
Late last night you come rolling across my mind


Well, the woman that I love, she's got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
Don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop
You know I love her, yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

If I ever lose her I'll go insane
I go half crazy when she call's my name
She says ba..ba..baby I lo..lo..love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
You know I love her, yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much too look at, but like I said
I love her, yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

I don't mean to say that she got nothing going
She's got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
When I get low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile, but her breath is sweet
You know I love her, yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world

The woman that I love, she's got a hook in her nose
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop
Don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop
I know I love her, yeah I love her
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world


Stake my future on a hell of a past
Looks like tomorrow is a-comin' on fast
Ain't complaining 'bout what I've got
Seen better times, but who has not

Silvio, silver and gold won't
Buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

Honest as the next day rolling that stone
When I come a-knockin' don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone

I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
Charm the whistle off the evening train

Silvio, silver and gold won't
Buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

Give what I got until I got no more
Take what I get 'til I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door

I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain

Silvio, silver and gold won't
Buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong
Let the echo decide it I was right or wrong

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know


I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.

You belong to someone else, and I do too It's just crazy bein' here with
you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.

I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice
It's too late to listen to that warning voice
All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.

You're not free to belong to me
And you know I could never be your own
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine
But we're heading for a wall of stone.

Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a pickin' up speed
Disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.


Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rollin' river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rollin' river
Indians camp a long her border
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rollin' river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rollin' river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rollin' river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear,
I'm bound to leave you Look away, you rollin' river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.


I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youth's early days I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me.

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me.

They all moved a way, said a voice of a stranger
"To that bautiful home by the bright crystal sea"
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me.

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me.






We live in a political world
Where love don't have any place
We're living in times where men commit crimes
And crime don't have a face

We live in a political world
Icicles hangin' down
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And clouds cover up the ground

We live in a political world
Wisdom is thrown into jail
It rots in a cell misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up the trail

We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank

We live in a political world
Courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted, children aren't wanted
Your next day could be your last

We live in a political world
The one we can see and feel
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck
We all know for sure that it's real

We live in a political world
The cities are a lonesome fear
Little by little, you turn in the middle
You're never sure why you're here

We live in a political world
Under the microscope
You could travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You've always got more than enough rope

We live in a political world
Turning and a-thrashing about
As soon as you're awake you're trained to take
What looks like the easy way out

We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall

We live in a political world
Everything's hers and his
Climb into the flame and shout God's name
But you're not even sure what it is


Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall

Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall

We bang the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
In the turning of twilight in the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
Strippin away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall

By rivers of blindness in love and with kindness
We can hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences to sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat

Roses are red violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall


Broken lines, broken strings, broken threads, broken springs
Broken idols, broken heads, people sleeping in broken beds
Ain't no use jivin', ain't no use jokin'
Everything is broken

Broken bottles, broken plates, broken switches, broken gates
Broken dishes, broken parts, streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken

Seems like every time you stop and turn around
Someone else has just hit the ground

Broken cutters, broken saws, broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones, broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin'
Everything is broken

Every time you leave and go off some place
Things fall to pieces in my face

Broken hands on broken plows, broken treaties, broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools, people bending broken rules
Hound dog howlin', bullfrog croakin'
Everything is broken


Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries 'cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide
And the world's on its side
And time is running backwards and so is the bride

Ring them bells Saint Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know
Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many
When the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When innocence dies

Ring them bells Saint Catherine from the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance between right and wrong


Crickets are chirpin', the water is high
There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry
The window's wide open, African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
She'd gone with the man in the long black coat

Somebody seen him hangin' around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible he'd quote
There was dust on the man in the long black coat

Preacher was a-talkin', there's a sermon he gave
He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it's you who must keep it satisfied
It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man in the long black coat

There are no mistakes in life, some people say
And it's true sometimes, you can see it that way
But people don't live or die, people just float
She went with the man in the long black coat

There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June
Treetrunks uprooted 'neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumblin' force
Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse
She never said nothin', there was nothin' she wrote
She'd gone with the man in the long black coat


Most of the time I'm clear focused all around
Most of the time I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the sign
I can stay right with it, and the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don't even notice that she's gone
Most of the time

Most of the time it's well understood
Most of the time I wouldn't change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive and I can endure
And I don't even think about her
Most of the time

Most of the time my head is on straight
Most of the time I'm strong enough not to hate
I don't build up illusion 'til it makes me sick
I ain't afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don't even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time

Most of the time she ain't even in my mind
I wouldn't know her if I saw her, she's that far behind
Most of the time I can't even be sure
If she was ever with me or if I was ever with her

Most of the time I'm halfways content
Most of the time I know exactly where it all went
I don't cheat on myself, I don't run and hide
Hide from the feelings that I buried inside
I don't compromise and I don't pretend
I don't even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time


What good am I if I'm like all the rest
If I just turn away when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off so I can't hear you cry
What good am I

What good am I if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thunder in the sky
What good am I

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try
What good am I

What good am I then to others and me
If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied, must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why, and where must I have been

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back when you silently die
What good am I


There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of
conceit
There's a whole lot of people struggling tonight with the disease of
conceit
Comes right down the highway, straight down the line
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind
Nothing about it that's sweet
The disease of conceit

There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit
There's a whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit
Steps into your room, eats into your soul
Over your senses you have no control
Ain't nothing too discreet
About the disease of conceit

There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit
There's a whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count
From the outside world the pressure will mount
Turn you into a piece of meat
The disease of conceit

Conceit is a disease but the doctors got no cure
They done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure

There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of
conceit
There's a whole lot of people seein' double tonight from the disease of
conceit
If your delusions of grandeur and an evil eye
Give you the idea that you're too good to die
Then they bury you from your head to your feet
From the disease of conceit


What was it you wanted, tell me again so I know
What's happening in there, what's goin' on with your show
What was it you wanted, could you say it again
I'll be back in a minute, you can get it together by then

What was it you wanted, you can tell me, I'm back
We can start it all over, get it back on the track
You got my attention, well, go ahead, speak
What was it you wanted when you were kissing my cheek

Was there somebody looking when you gimme that kiss
Someone there in the shadows, someone that I might have missed
Is there something you needed, something I don't understand
What was it you wanted, do I have it here in my hand

Whatever you wanted slipped outta my mind
Would you remind me again, if you'd be so kind
Has the record been breaking, did the needle just skip
Is there somebody waiting, was there a slip of the lip

What was it you wanted, I ain't keeping score
Are you the same person that was here before
Is it something important, maybe not
What was it you wanted, tell me again, I forgot

Whatever you wanted, what could it be
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me
Is it something comes natural, is is easy to say
Why do you want it, who are you anyway

Is the scenery changing, am I getting it wrong
Is the whole thing going backwards, are they playing our song
Where were you when it started, do you want it for free
What was it you wanted, are you talking to me


Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you
You're trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kinda wondered if you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you

Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see
Seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me

Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last firetruck from hell goes rollin' by
All good people are praying
It's the last temptation, the last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
Last radio's playing

Seen a shooting star tonight slip away
Tomorrow will be another day
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me
say
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away






She's got her pudding in the oven
And it's gonna be good.
She better not leave me
And go out to Hollywood.
She got the best pudding in the neighborhood.
She's my baby.

She can drive a truck,
She can drive a train.
She can even drive an aeroplane.
She's so good to look at in the rain.
She's my baby.

She's comin' down the sidewalk
She's stumblin through the door
She's coming home from places
she's never been before.
She sits down on the sofa
She poors herself a drink
Says, "Ooh honey, honey ain't no time to think."
My baby
My baby

(solo)

My baby
She's got a body for business
Got a head for sin
She knocks me over
like a bowling pin.
She came home last night and said,
"Honey, honey, honey it's hard to get ahead."
My baby
My baby

She can build a boat
She can make it float (My baby, m-my-my baby)
She can play my guitar
Note for Note
She likes to stick her tongue right down my throat.
She's my baby.
My baby.
My baby.
My baby.
repeat, fade.


Look out your window
That grass ain't green.
It's kinda yellow.
See what I mean?
Look up your chimney
The sky ain't blue.
It's kinda yellow.
You know it's true.
(It's so hard to figure what it's all about)

chorus
When your outsides in (inside out)
And your downsides up (upside down)
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)
Yeah, don't it make you wanna twist & shout
when you're inside out.

Look down your drain pipe.
What color do you see?
It's got to be yellow.
Don't try to fool me.
(and don't it make you wanna twist and shout)

chorus

Be careful where you're walking
You might step in something rough.
Be careful where you're talking
And saying all that stuff.
Take care when you are breathing
Something's funny in the air.
And somethings I'm not saying
Bout what's happening out there.
It's inside out.

Look into the future
With your mystic crystal ball.
See if it ain't yellow
See if it's there at all.
(Ain't no shadow of doubt
Don't it make you wanna twist and shout)

Chorus

Waltzing round the room tonight
In someone else's clothes.
You're always coming out of things
Smelling like a rose.
You hang your head and your heart is filled with so much misery...
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me.

You say let's go to the rodeo
And see some cowboy fall.
Sometimes it seems to me you've
Got no sympathy at all.
You keep on going on and on about how you're so free...
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me.

It ain't easy to get to you.
But there must be some kind of a way
If only two could look to you
For only one moment of each day.

You're saying that you're all washed up
Got nothing else to give.
Seems like you would've figured out
How long you have to live
You could feel like a baby again sitting on your daddy's knee...
Oh how happy you could be
If you belonged to me.

(harmonica solo)

The guy your with is a ruthless pimp
Everybody knows
Every cent he takes from you
Goes straight up his nose.
You look so sad, you're going so mad, any fool can see...
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belong to me.


While you're strolling down the fairway
Showing no remorse.
Glowing from the poisons
They've sprayed on your golf course
While you're busy sinking birdies,
And keeping your scorecard,
The devil's been busy in your back yard.

Steaming down the highway,
with your trucks of toxic waste,
Where you gonna hide it
In the outer space?
You don't know what you're doing
Or what you have to guard
The devil's been busy in your back yard.

Sometimes you think you're crazy
But you know you're only mad.
Sometimes your better off not knowing
How much you've been had.

You see your second cousin
Wasted in a fight.
You say he had it coming,
You couldn't do it right.
You're in a western movie, playing the part
The devil's been busy in your back yard.

(solo)

Sometimes they say you're wicked
But you know that can't be bad.
Sometimes you're better off not knowing
It'll only make you sad.

They're coming down picadilly
Dripping at the dash
Wasting sticky willy
Covering him with their cash.
They just might not have noticed, they've been beating him so hard
The devil's been busy in your back yard.


That's how the world begins
Watch out when you step in
For 7 deadly sins
That's when the son begins
(7 deadly sins)

(sin number one) was when you left me
(sin number two) you said goodbye
(sin number three) was when you told me
a little white lie.

Once it starts, it never ends.
Watch out aroung the bend.
A 7 deadly sins

(sin number four) was when you looked my way
(sin number five) was when you smiled
(sin number six) was when you let me stay
Sin number seven
Was when you touched me and told me why.

So many rules to bend
Time and time again


You walk in, half past nine
Lookin like a queen,
Serving me with papers,
Calling me obscene.
Woman I've tried so hard
Just to do my best
They're gonna put me in the Poor House
And you'll take all the rest.
Up all day, Down all night
Working on the job
Everything I do is wrong
I always end up right.
Woman I try so hard
Done all I can do.
They're gonna put me in the Poor House
Leave all the best for you.

ooo in the poor house
ooo in the poor house

If a drove a pulpwood truck
Would you love me more?
Will you bring me diamonds
And hang around my door
Woman , I've done my best
They're ain't much left for me.
They're gonna put me in the Poor House
And throw away the key.

ooo in the poor house

repeat 1st verse


Where were you last night?
You were so uptight.
What did you do, who did you see?
Were you with someone
Who reminded you of me?

Where were you last night?

Where were you last week?
Were you up a creek?
Did you stay up pacing the floor?
Got me worried
You ignore me more and more.

Where were you last night?
You weren't around me
When they found me.
Where were you last night?

(solo)

You better stop your messin around
Your name is going round from town to town
It's making me sad
Making me fell bad
Where were you last night?

Where were you last year?
You sure as hell weren't here.
You weren't waiting where you said.
You sent someone in your place instead.

Where were you last night?
It's getting to me
Making me gloomy
Where were you last night?


Well I woke up this morning
The place was such a reck
I couldn't reach the bathroom
Thought I'd better clear the deck.
I tried to call the lawyer
And ask him what to do
He referred me to his doctor
Who referred me back to you
And when you checked the manual
You kept in side the case
It said 'put it in a cool dry place'

I drove around the city
Looking for a room
That was high above the water
Where my things could be in tune
There was noone to help me
Nobody even cared
I had to got through hell
To get those things up there
I paid my first subscription
Then I joined the idle race
and they said 'Store it in a cool dry place'

I got guitar, basses, amplifiers and drums
Accordions and Mandolis and things that sometimes hum
Cymbals and Harmonicas, capos by the score
And lots of things in boxes laying all around the floor

Some places they get mildew
And others get too hot.
Some places are so damp that
Everything you got just rots
All kinds of condensation
Directories of the rain
There's not much compensation
When everything's been stained.
Some have sentimental value that
Cannot be erased
Go store it in a cool dry place

We got solids and acoustics
And some from flowered board
And some are trimmed in leather
And some are made with gourds
There's organs and trombones
And reverbs we can use
Lots of dx-7s
And old athletic shoes
I bought a great big building
It took up one whole block
I made an inventory
Of all the things in stock
The place was getting longer
I was up all night
I used up all my pencils
But I went onto spite
The blury of my vision
The sweat upon my face
I've got to put this stuff away
I mustn't leave a trace
The landlord's breathing down my neck
He say's it's a disgrace
So i said "put it in a cool, dry, place.


I don't want nothing
Nothing but you.
Am I waiting,
Looking for a new blue moon.
I'm so tired waiting
Waiting for you.
Am I waiting
Looking for a new blue moon.

So many moons have come and gone
And none of them were blue
So many times the son came up but
Came up without you, you, ya yoo hoo oo

You don't call me
Call me lonely
Am I waiting
Looking for a new blue moon

repeat chorus

Someday when you hold me
Someday you may see.
I was waiting
Looking for a new blue moon
I was waiting
Looking for a new blue moon

Blue Moon
You Took My Breath Away

You took my breath away
Now I want it back again
Look at the mess i"m in
I don't know what to say,
I don't know how to feel
YOu don't care anyway
all I can do is write
YOu took my breath away.
YOu took this song of mine,
And changed the little bit
It used to sound alright
But now the words don't fit.
It's getting hard to rhyme
Impossible to play
I've tried it many times
YOu took my breath away.

One day when the sun is shining
There will be that silver lining

You knocked my headlights out
So turn them on again
I can't see where I'm going
I can't tell where I've been
I don't know how to feel
This hasn't been my day
Seems like I've lost a wheel
You took my breath away.

YOu took my breath away
You took my breath away
You took my breath away.


Put your hand on your head
Put your foot in the air
Then you hop around the room
In your underwear
Ain't ever been nothin quite like this
Come on baby do the wilbury twist

Lift your other foot up
and fall on your ass
Get back up
Put your teethi in a glass
Ain't ever been nothin quite like this
It's a magical thing called the wilbury twist

Roll up your rug
Dust your broom
BAll th jack
Howl at the moon
Aint ever been nothing quite like this
Everybody's trying to do the wilbury twist

Turn your lights down low
Put your blindfold on
You'll never know
Where your friends have gone
Could be years before you're missed
Everybody's trying to do the Wilbury twist

It's a different dance
For you to do
Spin your body
Like a screw

Better not forget it on your shopping list
You can stop and buy one
It's the wilbury twist.




Bob Dylan


Frankie was a good girl, everybody knowed
Paid one hundred dollars for Albert's new suit and clothes
He was a man that done her wrong

Albert said, "I'm leavin' you, won't be gone for long
Don't wait up for me or worry 'bout me when I'm gone"
He was a man that done her wrong

Frankie went down to the corner saloon, get a bucket of beer
Said to the bartender "Has my lovin' man been here"
He was a man that done her wrong

"Well I ain't gonna tell you no stories, I ain't gonna tell you no lies
Saw Albert an hour ago with girl name Alice Bride"
He was a man that done her wrong

Frankie went down to twelfth street, look up in the window high
She saw her Albert there lovin' up Alice Bride
He was a man that done her wrong

Frankie pulled out a pistol, pulled out a forty-four
Gun went off, a rooty-toot-toot, and Albert fell on the floor
He was a man that done her wrong

Frankie got down upon her knees, took'a Albert into her lap
Started to hug and kiss him but there wasn't no bringing him back
He was a man that done her wrong

Gimme thousand policemen, ??? hotel
"I shot my Albert dead and now I'm goin' to jail
He was my man, but he done me wrong"

Judge said to the jury, "Plain as plain can be
A woman shot her lover down, it was murder in the second degree
He was a man that done her wrong"

Frankie went to the scaffolf, calm as a girl could be
Turned her eyes up towards the heavens, said "Nearer my God to be"
He was a man, but he done her wrong


Come and listen for a moment lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail.

by the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge says he
O For life Jim Jones I 'm sending you
Across the stormy sea.

O take a trip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get to gay Botney Bay
or else you'll surely hang.

Or else you'll surely hang says he
And after that Jim Jones
Is high up upon the gallows tree--
The crows will pick your bones.

Well our ship was high upon the sea when
Pirates came along.
But the soldiers on our convict ship were
full 500 strong.

O they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that
Pirate ship than gone to Botney bay.

With the storms a raging around us
And the winds a blowing gales
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales.

There's no time for mischief there they say
Remember that says they
For they'll flog the person out of you
Down there in Botney Bay.

Now its day and night the irons clang and
Like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves.

Well its by and by I'll slip my chains
Into the bush I'll go
I'll join the bravest rangers there
Jack Donahoe and Co.

And some dark night when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the floggers down.

Oh I'll give the law a little shock
To remeber what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent
Jim Jones in chains to Botney Bay.


Blackjack Davey came a ridin' on by whistling loud and merry
Made the words around him ring and he charmed the heart of a lady
Charmed the heart of a lady

How old are you my pretty little miss
How old are you my honey
She answered to him with a lovin' smile, "I'll be sixteen come Sunday,
Be sixteen come Sunday"

"Come and go with me my pretty little miss
Come and go with me my honey
Take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money
Never will want for money"

"Pull off, pull off those high heeled shoes
Well made of Spanish leather
Git behind me on my white horse
And we'll ride off together
We'll both go off together"

Well she pulled off them high heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together
They both rode off together

That night the boss came home inquirying about his lady
The servant spoke before she thought, "She's been with Blackjack Davey,
Rode off with Blackjack Davey"

"Well saddle for me my coal black stud
He's speedier than the grave
I rode all day and I'll ride all night and I'll overtake my lady
I'll bring back my lady"

Well he rode all night 'til the broad daylight
'Til he came to a river ragin'
And there he spied his darlin' bride in the arms of Blackjack Davey
Wrapped up with Blackjack Davey

"Pull off, Pull off them long blue gloves
Well made of the finest leather
Give to me your lilly white hand and we'll go home together
We'll both go home together"

Well she pulled off them long blue gloves
Well made of the finest leather
Gave to him her lilly white hand and said goodbye forever
Bid farewell forever

Would you forsake your house and home, would you forsake your baby
Would you forsake your husband too
To go with Blackjack Davey
Ride off with Blackjack Davey

"Well I've forsaken my house and home and I'll forsake my baby
I'll forsake my husband too
For the love of Blackjack Davey
Love my Blackjack Davey"

"Last night I slept in a feather bed between my husband and baby
Tonight I lay on the river banks in the arms of Blackjack Davey
Love my Blackjack Davey"


Well ??? and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town called Canadee-I-O

So she bargained with the sailor boy, offered piece of gold
Straightway then he lead her down into the hold
Saying, "I'll dress you up in sailors clothes, your jacket shall be blue"
You'll see that seaport town called Canadee-I-O

Now when the other sailors heard the news, well they fell into enrage
And with all the ships company they were willin' to engage
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet my boys, overboard we'll throw her
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-I-O"

Now when the captain he heard the news, well he too fell in enrage
And with the whole ships company he was willin' to engage
Saying, "She'll stay on in sailors clothes, her color shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-I-O"

Now when they came down to Canada, scarcely half 'bout a year
She's married this bull captain who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a girlish charm
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-I-O

C'mon you fair and gentle girls whereever you so may be
I'll have you follow your on true love, when I goes to sea
For if the sailors prove false to you, well the captain he might prove
true
You'll see what I have gained by the wearin' of the blue


Was in the summer, one early fall
Just trying to find my baby all in all
Now she's gone, I don't worry, Lord I'm sittin' on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer's day
That's when she left me, she gone to stay
Now she's gone, I don't worry, Lord I'm sittin' on top of the world

Now don't come runnin' holdin' up your hands
Can't get me a woman quick as you can get a man
Now she's gone and I don't worry, Lord I'm sittin' on top of the world

Had been for days, didn't know your name
Why should I worry, I'll crave you in vain
Now she's gone, I don't worry, Lord I'm sittin' on top of the world

Went to the station down in the yard
Got me a freight train when the goin' got hard
Now she's gone, I don't worry, Lord I'm sittin' on top of the world

The lonesome days they have gone by
Why should I beg you, you said goodbye
Now she's gone, I don't worry, Lord I'm sittin' on top of the world


Ohh where is little Maggie, over yonder she stands
Rifle on her shoulder, six shooter in her hand
How can I ever stand it, just to see them two blue eyes
Shinin' like some diamond, like some diamond in the sky
Rather be in some lonely holler, where the sun don't every shine
Than see you be another man's darlin' and to know that you'll never be
mine

Well it's march me away to the station with my suitcase in my hand
Yeah it's march me away to the station, I'm off to some far just land
Sometimes I have a nickle and sometimes I have a dime
Sometimes I have ten dollars just to pay little Maggie whose mine
Pretty flowers are made for bloomin', pretty stars are made to shine
Pretty girls are made for boys' love, little Maggie was made for mine

Well yonder stands little Maggie with a dram glass in her hand
She's drinkin' down her troubles over courtin' some other man


Let us pause in life's pleasures and count it's many tears
While we all sob sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Ahh hard times come again no more

Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Ahh hard times come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty and music night and day
There are frail forms banging at the door
Though there voices are silent, there pleading looks will say
Ahh hard times come again no more

Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Ohh hard times come again no more

There's a pale droopy maiden who toils her life away
With the worn heart ???
The boys that would me merry, all the day
Ahh hard times come again no more

Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Ahh hard times come again no more

Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Ahh hard times come again no more

Can't stand the past, swear you gotta step it up and go

Tell my woman she not home
Ain't a lovin' but she been gone
Gotta step it up and go, yeah go
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go

Well I sing this verse, ain't gonna sing no more
??? I gotta go
Step it up and go, yeah go
Can't stand back, swear you gotta step it up and go


Tomorrow night will you remember what you said tonight
Tomorrow night will all the thrill be gone
Tomorrow night will it be just another memory
Or just another song that's in my heart to linger on

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willingly surrender to me darling will it last
Tomorrow night will you be with me when the moon is bright
Tomorrow night will you say those lovely things you said tonight

Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast
And you willing surrender to me, but darling will it last
Tomorrow night will be with me when the moon is bright
Tomorrow night will you say those lovely things you said tonight


Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
Ah mark what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas mornin'

Now for recreation we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corparal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intendin' to camp
For the day being pleasant and charmin'

"Good morning, good morning" the Sergeant did cry
"And the same to you gentlemen" we did reply
Intendin' no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning

But says he "My fine fellows if you will enlist
It's ten guineas in gold I will slip in your fists
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the King's health in the morning

For a soldier he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charmin' young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming

And a soldier he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows look dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning"

But says Arthur "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
And you dare not change them one night for you know
If you do you'll be flogged in the mornin'

And although that we are single and free
We take great delight in our own company
And we have no desire strange faces to see
Although that your offers are charming

And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we'd barter on chance
For you would have no scruple for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning"

"Oh no," says the Sergeant, "I'll have no such chat
And neither will take it from spalpeen or brat
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning"

And Arthur and I we soon drew our odds
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their heads
And bade them take that as fair warning

And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
"Now take them out, devils," cried Arthur McBride
"And temper their edge in the mornin'"

And the little wee drummer we flattened his ball
And we made a foot-bowl of his rowdy-dowd-dowd
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning

And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
And we paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered at them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning

And so to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them our clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning

Me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside
Ah mark what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas mornin'


You're gonna quit me baby
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord

Now there's a man you'll hear about most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas and his name is Diamond Joe
He carries all his money in a diamond studded jar
Never took much trouble with the process of the law

Well I did up to Diamond Joe boys, did offer him my hand
He gave me a string of horses so old they could not stand
And I never starved to death boys, he did mistreat so
I never saved a dollar in the pay of Diamond Joe

There was bread ??? and his meat he couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy with the waggin' of his jaw
And the tellin' of his stories, I mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder that could lie like Diamond Joe

I tried three times to quit him, but he did argue so
I'm still punchin' cattle in the pay of Diamond Joe
And when I'm called up yonder and its my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddy, give the fleas to Diamond Joe

My baby told me I would have to go
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good, baby. Honey, because the world gone wrong.

Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying 'cause the world goin' wrong
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good, baby. Honey, because the world goin' wrong.

I told you baby, right to your head,
If I didn't leave you I would have to kill you dead
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good, baby. Honey, 'cause the world goin' wrong.

I tried to be lovin', and treat you kind
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good, baby. Honey, 'cause the world's goin' wrong.

'F you had a woman and she don't treat you kind
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good, baby. Honey, because the world goin' wrong.

Say it when you be good now, can't do no more
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before
I can't be good, baby. Honey, because the world's goin' wrong.

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before


"Get down, get down, Love Henry" she cried
"And stay all night with me
You can have gold chains and the finest I have,
I'll apply them all to thee."

"I can't get down and I shan't get down
Or stay all night with thee
There's a pretty little girl in Cornersville
I love far better than thee."

He laid his head on a pillow of down
Kisses, she gave him three
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
She murdered mortal he.

"Get well, get well, Love Henry," she cried
"Get well, get well," said she
I don't want to see my own heart's blood
A-flowing down so free."

She took him by his long yellow hair
And also by his feet.
She plunged him into well water where
It runs both cold and deep.

"Lie there, lie there, Love Henry," she cried
"Till the flesh rots off your bones
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return."

"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried
"Don't tell no news on me
All these costly beads around my neck,
I'll apply them all to thee."

"Fly down, fly down pretty bird," she cried
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And hung on a willow tree."

"I won't fly down, I can't fly down
A girl who would murder her own true love
Would kill a little bird like me."


Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry,
Ragged and dirty too
Broke and hungry,
Ragged and dirty too
If I clean up, sweet mama,
Can I stay all night with you?

Lord, I went to my window,
Babe, I couldn't see through my blinds
I went to my window,
Babe, I couldn't see through my blinds
I thought I heard my baby cry.

Lord, if I can't come in here, baby
Then just let me sit down in your door
If I can't come in here, baby
Then just let me sit down in your door
And I will leave so soon
That your man won't never know.

Ah, how can I live here, baby,
Lord, and feel at ease?
How can I live here, baby
Lord, and feel at ease?
But that woman that I got,
Man, she just does what she feels.

Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me
Baby, because I'm young and wild
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby
Because I'm young and wild
You must always remember,
Baby, you was once a child.

If I have to ride the blind
Leaving in the morning
If I have to ride the blind
Well, I've been mistreated
And I swear it, I don't mind dyin'.


Woke up this morning, feeling blue
Seen a good looking girl, can I make love with you
Hey, hey babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.
Hey, hey babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.

Hey, hey babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.

I don't care what in the world you do.

Delia was a gamblin' girl
Gambled all around
Delia was a gamblin' girl
She laid her money down.

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Delia's dear mother
Took a trip out west
When she returned
Little Delia'd gone to rest.

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Wouldn't have been so bad

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Cuddy's looking high
Cuddy's looking low
He shot poor Delia down
With a cruel .44.

All the friends I ever had are ... gone.

High upon the housetops
High as I can see
Looking for them rounders
Looking out for me.

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Man in Atlanta
Trying to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys
Six feet out of sight.

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Judge says to Cuddy
"What's this noise about?"
"All about them rounders, judge,
Tryin' to cut me out."

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Cuddy said to the judge
"What might be my fine?"
Judge says, "Poor boy,
You got 99."

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Cuddy's in the jailhouse
Drinking from an old tin cup
Delia's in the grave yard
She might never, never get up.

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Delia, oh Delia
How can it be?
You loved all them rounders
Never did love me.

All the friends I ever had are gone.

Delia, oh Delia
How could it be?
You wanted all them rounders
Never had time for me.

All the friends I ever had are gone.


Harland Alley, on a dark and grizzly night
Billy Lyons and Stack-a-Lee had one terrible fight
All about that John B. Stetson Hat.

Stack-a-Lee walked to the barroom and he called for a glass of beer
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, What you doin' here?

Stack-a-Lee, oh Stack-a-Lee please don't take my life
Got three little children and a weepin' loving wife
You're a bad man, a bad man Stack-a-Lee.

God Bless your children and I'll take care of your wife
You stole my John B. now I'm bound to take your life
All about that John B. Stetson Hat.

Stack-a-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head
Only take him one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead
All about that John B. Stetson Hat.

Sent for the doctor, well the doctor he did come
You're a bad man, a bad man Stack-a-Lee.

Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
back
All about that John B. Stetson Hat.

Must of been old Stack-a-Lee stumblin' in the dark

Our police walked on to Stack-a-Lee, he was lyin' fast asleep
My police kicked Stack-a-Lee and he jumped forty feet!

Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-a-Lee's bail
All about that John B. Stetson Hat.

Stack-a-Lee turned to the jailer, he said "Jailer, I can't stay
'Round my bed time Billy Lyons begin to grieve
All about that John B. Stetson Hat."


He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
His voice was low with pain
I'll do your bidding, comrade mine,
If I ride back again.
But if you ride back and I am left
You'll do as much for me
Mother, you know, must hear the news
So write to her tenderly.

She's a-waiting in a home like a patient saint
Her fallen face paled with woe
Her heart would be broken when I am gone
I'll see her soon, I know.
Just then the order came to charge
For an instant hand touched hand
They said "aye" and away they rode
That brave and devoted band

Straight was the track to the top of the hill
The rebels they shot and shelled
Plowed furroughs of death through the toiling ranks
And guarded them as they fell.
There soon came a horrible dying yell
From heights that they could not gain
And those whom doom and death had spared
Rode slowly down again.

But among the dead that were left on the hill
Was the boy with the curly hair
The tall dark man who rode by his side
Lay dead beside him there.
There's no one to write to the blue-eyed girl
The words that her lover had said
Mama, you know, awaits the news
And soon only know he's dead.


Oh, there was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell.

She had sweethearts a-plenty and men of high degree
There was none but Jackie Frazier, her true love e'er could be
Oh her true love e'er could be.

"Oh daughter, oh daughter your body I will confine
If none but Jack the Sailor would ever suit your mind"
Oh, would ever suit your mind.

"This body you may imprison, my heart you can't confine
There's none but Jack the Sailor would have this heart of mine"
Oh, can have this heart of mine.

Now, Jack he's gone a-sailing with trouble on his mind
To leave his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into the tailor shop and dressed in men's array
Then she went into a vessel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away.

"Before you step on board, sir, your name I'd like to know"
She smiled all in her countenance, said "They call me Jack-a-roe,
Oh, they call me Jack-a-roe."

"Your waist is light and slender, your fingers neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy for to face the cannonball"
Oh, to face the cannonball.

"I know my waist is slender and my fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble for to see ten thousand fall"
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.

The war soon being over, they hunted all around
Among the dead and dying, her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found.

She picked him up all in her arms and carried him into town
And sent for a physician to come and he healed his wound
Oh, quickly healed his wound.

This couple they got married, so well did they agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, so why not you and me?

B.F. White & A.M. Pace

I came to the place where the Lone Pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb
When, in a low whisper, I heard something say
"How sweetly I sleep here alone

The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
The tears are all wiped from my eyes

The cause of my master compelled me from home
No kindred or relative nigh
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb
My soul flew to mansions on high

Go tell my companion and children, most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone
The same hand that led me through scenes most severe
Has kindly assisted me home."




Prayin' in the ghetto, face in the cement,
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent,
Felt around for the light switch, became so nauseated.
Just me and an overworked dancer, between walls that are really
deteriorated.

Oh, set my affections on things above,
Let nothing stand in the way of that love,
Not even the Rock of Gibraltar!
Well, if you see her on Phantom Street,
Tell her I still think she's neat,
And that the groom's still waiting at the altar.

Highwaymen and hitmen, pushin', hellraisin', and robbery,
Mistakin' your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery.
I never did get the message, I don't even know when one was sent to me,
About the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be.

Oh, set my affections on things above,
Let nothing stand in the way of that love,
Not even the Rock of Gibraltar!
Well, if you see her on Phantom Street,
Tell her I still think she's neat,
And that the groom's still waiting at the altar.

Well, what can I say about Claudette, that wouldn't come back home to
haunt me.
Finally had to give her up, about the time she began to want me.
God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated.
I'd have done anything for that woman, if she'd only made me feel
obligated.

Oh, set my affections on things above,
Let nothing stand in the way of that love,
Not even the Rock of Gibraltar!
Well, if you see her on Phantom Street,
Tell her I still think she's neat,
And that the groom's still waiting at the altar.

Locked into a time-zone, with a high-degree temperature,
Fools counting their money, wise men standing around like furniture.
There's a wall between you and what you want, you gotta leap it.
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
keep it.

Oh, set my affections on things above,
Let nothing stand in the way of that love,
Not even the Rock of Gibraltar!
Well, if you see her on Phantom Street,
Tell her I still think she's neat,
And that the groom's still waiting at the altar.

Looked for the answer, found a solution,
Too rich for my blood and I needed a transfusion.
Don't know what I say about Claudette, she could be in the mountains or
the prairies,
She could be respectably married, or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires.

Oh, set my affections on things above,
Let nothing stand in the way of that love,
Not even the Rock of Gibraltar!
Well, if you see her on Phantom Street,
Tell her I still think she's neat,
And that the groom's still waiting at the altar.

Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel, thin man lookin' at his last meal
Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfield for dignity

Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass, young man lookin' in the shadows
that pass
Poor man lookin' through painted glass for dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searchin' high, searchin' low, searchin' everywhere I know
Askin' the cops wherever I go, "Have you seen Dignity?"

Blind man breakin' out of a trance, puts both his hands in the pocket of
chance
Hopin' to find one circumstance of dignity

I went to the wedding of Mary-lou, she said I don't want nobody see me
talkin to you
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew about dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men, wasn't any difference
to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade, house on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid, "Have you seen dignity?"

Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
Lookin' into the lost forgotten years for dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused by dignity

Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand, steps goin' down into tatoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light, in the bordertowns of
despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat, I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin'
boat
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote about dignity

Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure, lookin' at his hands for the lines
that were
And into every masterpiece of literature for dignity

Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
Combin his hair back his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within for dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed, dignity never been
photographed
I went into the red, went into the black, into the valley of dry bone
dreams

So many roads, so much at stake, so many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the
lake
Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take to find dignity 8. Silvio ( )


I was thinkin' of a series of dreams
were nothin' comes up to the top
everything stays down where it's wounded
and comes to a permanent stop

wasn't thinking of anything specific
like in a dream were someone wakes up and screams
nothin' too very scientific
just thinking of a series of dreams

thinking of a series of dreams
where the time and the tempo drag
and there's no exit in any direction (suddenly the gate was thrown open)
except the one you can't see with your eyes (and you're left there holding
the bag)
wasn't making any great connection
wasn't falling for any intricate scheme
nothing that would pass inspection
I was just thinking of a series of dreams

dreams where the umbrella is folded
and into the path where I heard
and the cards are no good that you're holding
unless they're from another world...

In one the surface was frozen
in another I witnessed a crime
in one I was running and in another
all I seemed to be doing was crying
wasn't looking for any special assistance
nor going through any great extremes
I'd already gone the distance
just thinking of a series of dreams

dreams where the umbrella is folded
and into the path where I heard
and the cards are no good that you're holding
unless they're from another world...

I'd already gone the distance
just thinkin' of a series of dreams
just thinkin' of a series of dreams
just thinkin' of a series of dreams


John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore.
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all.
His mama's face broke out all in a grin.

"Oh son, you look so fine, I'm glad you're a son of mine,
You make me proud to know you hold a gun.
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get,
And we'll put them on the wall when you come home."

As that old train pulled out, John's ma began to shout,
Tellin' ev'ryone in the neighborhood:
"That's my son that's about to go, he's a soldier now, you know."
She made well sure her neighbors understood.

She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door.
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun,
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war.

Oh! Good old-fashioned war!

Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come.
They ceased to come for about ten months or more.
Then a letter finally came saying, "Go down and meet the train.
Your son's a-coming home from the war."

She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight.
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last,
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes.

Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist.
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know,
While she couldn't even recognize his face!

Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face.

"Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done.
How is it you come to be this way?"
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away.

"Don't you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud.
You wasn't there standing in my shoes."

"Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I'm a-tryin' to kill somebody or die tryin'.
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine."

Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

"And I couldn't help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink,
That I was just a puppet in a play.
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke,
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away."

As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seein' the metal brace that helped him stand.
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand.
